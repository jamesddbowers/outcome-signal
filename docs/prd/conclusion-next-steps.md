# Conclusion & Next Steps

## MVP Scope Summary

This PRD defines **9 epics with 64 user stories** for the OutcomeSignal MVP, targeting a **6-month development timeline** (Months 1-6). The MVP delivers:

1. **Core Infrastructure:** Turborepo monorepo, Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Supabase database, Clerk auth, Stripe billing
2. **Three-Column Workspace:** Hierarchy tree, document preview, agent chat with responsive design
3. **Trial Management:** 7-day trial with Brief-only limit, paywall modal, subscription tiers (Starter $49, Pro $149, Enterprise $499)
4. **OutcomeSignal Agents:** 7 specialized agents (Discovery, Requirements, Design, Architecture, Quality, Validation, Planning) with functional names and BMAD personalities
5. **Planning Phase:** 8 document types (Brief, PRD, Architecture, UX, Security, QA, Market Research, Competitive Analysis) with approval gates and intelligent backfilling
6. **Document Management:** Versioning, export (markdown and ZIP), search, sharing, sharding for context retrieval
7. **Hierarchy Display:** Read-only Initiative → Epic tree (epics from PRD), Initiative CRUD with tier limits
8. **LLM A/B Testing:** Gemini 2.5 Pro vs Claude Sonnet 4.5 comparison with quality/cost/performance metrics
9. **Monitoring & Analytics:** Sentry, Cloud Logging, usage analytics, conversion funnels, uptime monitoring

## Success Criteria (Month 6 MVP Launch)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Time to First Value** | <30 minutes (signup → first Brief approved) | Analytics funnel |
| **Document Approval Rate** | 80%+ (first drafts approved with minor edits) | `llm_metrics` table |
| **Trial → Paid Conversion** | 20-30% | Analytics funnel |
| **System Uptime** | 99%+ | UptimeRobot |
| **LLM Cost per Document** | <$0.10 | `llm_metrics.cost_per_document` |
| **p95 Response Time** | <30s for document generation | `llm_metrics.response_time_ms` |
| **Monthly Active Users** | 100+ (design partners + early adopters) | Analytics |
| **MRR** | $2,000+ (20 paid users @ avg $100/mo) | Stripe dashboard |

## Post-MVP Roadmap (Phase 2.0+)

**Month 7-12: Execution Phase & Integrations**
- **Planning Agent Story Creation:** Full vertical slice user stories from sharded PRD + Architecture + UX (see BMAD `create-next-story.py` workflow)
- **Editable Hierarchy:** User-created epics, features, stories (beyond PRD-generated epics)
- **Execution Phase Integration:** Linear, Jira, Azure Boards sync for story export
- **Team Collaboration:** Multi-user workspaces, role-based permissions (Owner, Editor, Viewer)
- **Advanced Exports:** Notion sync, GitHub markdown commits, Confluence integration
- **Design System Evolution:** Custom themes, white-label for Enterprise tier

**Phase 3.0: Scale & Intelligence**
- **AI Enhancements:** Auto-detect requirements gaps, suggest test cases, predict risks
- **Multi-Initiative Planning:** Cross-Initiative dependencies, portfolio view
- **Advanced Analytics:** Predictive delivery timelines, team velocity tracking
- **Mobile Apps:** Native iOS/Android apps
- **ChatGPT/Claude Desktop Integration:** Native interfaces via Apps SDK and MCP

## Out of Scope for MVP

To maintain focus and hit the 6-month timeline, the following are explicitly **deferred**:
- Hard delete for Initiatives (soft delete only)
- Real-time collaboration (multi-user editing)
- Custom agent training (using BMAD personalities as-is)
- Third-party integrations (Linear, Jira, Notion)—Phase 2+
- Story creation and task breakout (Planning Agent)—Phase 2+
- Advanced document diffing and merge tools
- Email notifications for approvals, updates
- Inline document editing (TipTap is read-only in MVP)
- Custom branding/white-label (Enterprise feature)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **LLM costs exceed $0.10/doc** | High (margin compression) | A/B test Gemini vs Claude, optimize prompts, implement caching |
| **Approval rate below 80%** | High (poor UX, low retention) | Design partner feedback loop, prompt refinement, fallback to simpler templates |
| **Trial conversion below 20%** | Medium (revenue miss) | Paywall optimization, value demonstration in trial (Brief quality), upgrade CTAs |
| **Vertex AI agent orchestration complexity** | Medium (dev timeline slip) | Spike Epic 5.1 in Month 1, fallback to simpler LangChain orchestration if needed |
| **Stripe webhook failures** | Medium (billing issues) | Idempotent webhook processing, manual fallback for failed syncs, alerting |
| **Supabase RLS misconfiguration** | High (data leak) | Security audit pre-launch, automated tests for RLS policies, penetration testing |

## Stakeholder Alignment

**For Engineering Team:**
- Epic 1-2 (Foundation, Workspace) are critical path—prioritize for Month 1-2
- Epic 4 (BMAD rebranding) can run in parallel with infrastructure work
- Epic 8 (LLM A/B testing) requires design partner feedback—plan for Month 2-3

**For Design/UX:**
- Three-column workspace is novel UX—invest in responsive design testing (Story 2.6)
- Approval gate UX (buttons + natural language) needs user testing
- Agent personality copy (prompts) requires collaboration with PM on tone

**For Product/Business:**
- Trial limits (Brief-only) are aggressive for conversion—monitor closely in design partner phase
- Starter tier ($49/mo, 3 Initiatives) pricing validated against Notion AI ($10/mo, limited) and Jasper ($49/mo, content generation)
- LLM decision (Epic 8) must complete by Month 2 to lock in infrastructure costs

## Go-to-Market Alignment

**Design Partner Phase (Month 1-3):**
- Recruit 10-20 solo developers, indie hackers, small dev teams
- Goals: Validate approval rate, trial conversion, LLM selection
- Deliverable: Product-market fit confirmation, testimonials

**Private Beta (Month 4-5):**
- Expand to 50-100 users via waitlist
- Goals: Stress test infrastructure, refine onboarding, optimize conversion funnel
- Deliverable: <5% error rate, 99%+ uptime, 25%+ trial conversion

**Public Launch (Month 6):**
- Open signups, marketing launch (Product Hunt, Hacker News, Twitter)
- Goals: 500+ signups in Month 6, $2K+ MRR
- Deliverable: Stable product, support infrastructure, growth loop

**Document Status:** ✅ **Approved for Development**
**Next Steps:**
1. Engineering kickoff (Epic 1.1: Initialize monorepo)
2. PM to update [brief.md](brief.md) for Brief-only trial (pending task from conversation)
3. Schedule design partner recruitment (PM + Marketing)
4. Create Linear workspace and import stories from this PRD
