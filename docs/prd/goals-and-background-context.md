# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver an intelligent SDLC orchestration platform that guides users from ideation through production-ready specifications
- Enable solo developers and small teams to create professional-grade planning documentation without dedicated PMs/architects
- Reduce planning time from 30+ days to 7 days or less through AI agent orchestration
- Achieve 80%+ document approval rate (agent drafts require minimal revisions)
- Establish OutcomeSignal as system-of-record for planning artifacts while integrating with Linear, Jira, Notion, and Azure Boards
- Reach $60K MRR ($720K ARR) by end of Year 1 with 500 paying customers
- Maintain unit economics with 80%+ gross margins and <$500 Customer Acquisition Cost
- Build natural learning through opinionated workflows that teach SDLC best practices conversationally

## Background Context

Software teams struggle to maintain comprehensive, consistent documentation across the SDLC. Analysis artifacts (briefs, research) don't properly cascade into planning documents (PRDs, architecture), creating gaps that lead to miscommunication, scope creep, and failed projects. Studies show 70% of software projects fail due to poor requirements (see [Project Brief: Problem Statement](brief.md#problem-statement)), with teams spending 8-12 hours weekly searching for context across documentation silos.

Current tools are either too rigid (Jira, Linear—great for execution, poor for upfront planning) or too freeform (Notion, Confluence—flexible but provide no guidance or structure). OutcomeSignal bridges this gap by providing a single AI agent that orchestrates 6 specialized sub-agents across Planning phase (see [Project Brief: Proposed Solution](brief.md#proposed-solution)) to create all upstream project documentation. The three-column workspace (hierarchy navigation, live document preview, agent chat) provides visual hierarchy and unified context, while the system-of-record architecture enables platform migration safety and multi-platform support.
