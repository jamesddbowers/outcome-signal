## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- NFR1: Agent response time shall be <3s for simple queries, <30s for document generation
- NFR2: UI interaction feedback shall be <100ms (button clicks, navigation)
- NFR3: Document preview rendering shall be <500ms for markdown documents up to 100 pages
- NFR4: Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime shall have <1s latency

**Scalability**
- NFR5: System shall support 100-500 concurrent users in MVP phase without performance degradation
- NFR6: Supabase Realtime shall handle 1,000+ concurrent agent conversations

**Reliability & Availability**
- NFR7: System shall maintain 99% uptime during MVP phase (Month 1-6)
- NFR8: System shall maintain 99.9% uptime for Enterprise tier (Month 12+)
- NFR9: Supabase database shall perform daily automated backups

**Security & Compliance**
- NFR10: All data at rest shall be encrypted using AES-256 (Supabase default)
- NFR11: All data in transit shall use HTTPS with TLS 1.3
- NFR12: Integration credentials (Linear, Jira, Notion API tokens) shall be encrypted in database
- NFR13: System shall support GDPR data export on request
- NFR14: System shall implement soft delete â†’ hard delete after 30 days for account deletion

**Cost Optimization**
- NFR15: LLM API costs shall remain <$0.10 per document generation to maintain 80%+ gross margins
- NFR16: Infrastructure costs shall stay within $285-335/mo for MVP phase (<100 users)
- NFR17: System shall A/B test Gemini 2.5 Pro vs Claude Sonnet 4.5 in Month 1-2 (design partner phase) before selecting primary LLM; selection criteria: approval rate (target 80%+), cost per document (target <$0.10), response time (target <30s for document generation)

**Usability**
- NFR18: New users shall complete first document approval within 30 minutes (time to first value)
- NFR19: System shall maintain 80%+ document approval rate (first drafts acceptable with minor edits)
- NFR20: Trial signup flow shall require no credit card (reduce friction)

**Maintainability**
