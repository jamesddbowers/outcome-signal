# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

OutcomeSignal embodies **"Executive Delegation"** as the core interaction paradigm—users act as executives directing a capable AI planning team. The interface should feel like a conversation with a smart PM who manages specialists behind the scenes, not like wrestling with a complex tool. Visual hierarchy (three-column workspace) provides spatial awareness of project structure, current document context, and agent conversation simultaneously, reducing cognitive load and context switching.

The UX prioritizes **clarity over cleverness**: no hidden features, no ambiguous states, no "magic" that users can't understand. Every agent action should have visible status, every document version should be traceable, and every transition should be explicit. This transparency builds trust in AI-generated content while maintaining the delightful simplicity of chat-based interaction.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**1. Conversational Workflow with Spatial Context**
- Users converse naturally with the primary agent in the right column
- Middle column provides live preview of what's being discussed/generated
- Left column maintains "you are here" orientation within project hierarchy
- No mode switching—users stay in one workspace from idea to backlog

**2. Progressive Disclosure**
- Trial users see simplified experience (1 Initiative, Brief-only document)
- Paid users unlock full capabilities (unlimited Initiatives for Pro/Enterprise, all 8 document types)
- Agent reveals complexity gradually ("Now that we have the Brief, let's move to PRD creation...")
- Advanced features (integrations, exports) appear contextually when unlocked

**3. Approval Gates as Decision Points**
- Every document generation ends with human approval gate
- "Approve" / "Need Changes" buttons + natural language interpretation
- Approval advances workflow; rejection loops back for refinement
- Visual phase indicators show progress (Planning 33% → 66% → 100%)

**4. Intelligent Backfilling**
- Users can jump ahead ("I want to create a PRD")
- Agent detects missing prerequisites ("I notice we don't have a Brief yet—let me help you create that first")
- Backwards navigation to fill gaps, then forward to original intent
- Non-linear planning that self-corrects to maintain structure

## Core Screens and Views

**1. Dashboard / Initiative List**
- Primary landing page after login
- Card-based grid of Initiatives with title, status, last updated
- Trial users: "1 of 1 Initiative" badge + upgrade CTA
- Paid users: "Create New Initiative" prominent action

**2. Three-Column Workspace (Main Application View)**
- **Left Column:** Collapsible hierarchy tree with Initiative → Epics (from PRD) navigation
- **Middle Column:** Live document preview with TipTap rendering, scroll-synced to conversation
- **Right Column:** Agent chat interface with phase indicators, sub-agent status, approval buttons

**3. Paywall / Upgrade Modal**
- Triggered at trial end (7 days) OR limit breach (2nd Initiative, 2nd document, export attempt)
- Shows current plan, feature comparison table, tier selection
- Stripe checkout embedded or redirect
- Dismissible only if trial still valid

**4. Account Settings**
- Subscription management (Stripe Customer Portal link)
- Usage dashboard (credits used/remaining, Initiative count)
- Integrations panel (Linear, Jira, Notion connection settings)—Phase 2.0+
- Export history (Phase 2.0+)

**5. Document Export View**
- Per-document: Download button → `.md` file
- Bulk export: "Export All as ZIP" → compressed archive
- Export history/log for audit trail (Phase 2.0+)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

OutcomeSignal targets **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance to ensure usability for developers with visual, motor, or cognitive disabilities. Key considerations:

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full workspace navigable via keyboard (Tab, Arrow keys, Enter for selection)
- **Screen Reader Support:** Semantic HTML, ARIA labels for dynamic content (agent messages, document updates)
- **Color Contrast:** 4.5:1 minimum for text, 3:1 for UI components (leveraging shadcn/ui's accessible defaults)
- **Focus Indicators:** Visible focus states for all interactive elements
- **Text Resizing:** UI remains functional at 200% zoom without horizontal scroll
- **Error Identification:** Clear error messages for form validation, API failures

**Deferred to Phase 3+:** WCAG AAA (higher contrast, sign language, extended audio descriptions)

## Branding

**Visual Identity:**
- **Style:** Clean, professional, developer-focused aesthetic (not playful/consumer)
- **Color Palette:** Leveraging shadcn/ui defaults (neutral grays, subtle blues for primary actions)
- **Typography:** System fonts (SF Pro on macOS, Segoe UI on Windows, Roboto on Linux) for performance and native feel
- **Iconography:** Lucide React icons (consistent with shadcn/ui ecosystem)

**Personality in Copy:**
- Agent messages: Professional but approachable ("Let's get started on your Project Brief")
- Status indicators: Occasionally playful for long-running tasks ("Architecture Agent: Evaluating tech stacks...")
- Error messages: Helpful and actionable ("We couldn't connect to Linear. Check your API token in Settings")

**No Custom Branding Required:** OutcomeSignal IS the brand (not white-label/multi-tenant in MVP)

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary Platform:** Web application (desktop-first, mobile-responsive)

**Supported Devices:**
- **Desktop (Primary):** 1280px+ width, optimized for 1920×1080 and 2560×1440 displays
- **Laptop:** 1024px+ width, three-column layout adapts (narrower columns)
- **Tablet (iPad):** 768px+ width, two-column layout (hierarchy collapses to drawer, preview + chat side-by-side)
- **Mobile (Progressive Degradation):** 375px+ width, single-column layout (tabs for hierarchy, preview, chat)

**Browser Support:**
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium) 100+
- Firefox 100+
- Safari 15.4+
- No IE11 support (end-of-life)

**Future Platforms (Post-MVP):**
- Phase 1.0: ChatGPT Apps SDK (native ChatGPT interface)
- Phase 1.5: Claude Desktop MCP (native Claude Desktop interface)
- Phase 4+: Native mobile apps (iOS, Android)
