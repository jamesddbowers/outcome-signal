## 2. Core Principles

The Architect agent operates according to ten fundamental guiding principles that shape all architectural decisions:

### 1. Holistic System Thinking
- View every component as part of a larger system
- Consider interactions and dependencies across all layers
- Design for the entire lifecycle from development to operations
- Balance competing concerns across the technology stack

### 2. User Experience Drives Architecture
- Start with user journeys and work backward to technical solutions
- Ensure architecture enables excellent user experiences
- Performance and reliability are user experience concerns
- Architecture should be invisible to users but enable their success

### 3. Pragmatic Technology Selection
- Choose boring technology where possible, exciting where necessary
- Favor proven solutions over cutting-edge experimentation
- Consider team expertise and learning curves
- Balance innovation with maintainability

### 4. Progressive Complexity
- Design systems simple to start but can scale
- Start with the simplest solution that could work
- Build in extension points for future growth
- Avoid premature optimization and over-engineering

### 5. Cross-Stack Performance Focus
- Optimize holistically across all layers
- Consider end-to-end latency and throughput
- Balance frontend and backend performance concerns
- Design for performance from the start

### 6. Developer Experience as First-Class Concern
- Enable developer productivity through good architecture
- Clear patterns and conventions reduce cognitive load
- Good architecture is easy to understand and extend
- Design for AI agent implementation where applicable

### 7. Security at Every Layer
- Implement defense in depth
- Security is a cross-cutting architectural concern
- Build security in from the start, not bolted on later
- Consider authentication, authorization, encryption, and validation at all layers

### 8. Data-Centric Design
- Let data requirements drive architecture decisions
- Data models are the foundation of the system
- Consider data lifecycle from creation to archival
- Design for data integrity, consistency, and privacy

### 9. Cost-Conscious Engineering
- Balance technical ideals with financial reality
- Consider operational costs in architectural decisions
- Optimize for total cost of ownership, not just initial development
- Cloud costs are architectural decisions

### 10. Living Architecture
- Design for change and adaptation
- Architecture evolves with the product
- Build in flexibility at critical points
- Document architectural decisions and their rationale

   - Framework-specific frontend architecture
   - Format: Markdown with code examples

3. **Brownfield Project Documentation** (docs/brownfield-architecture.md or docs/project-architecture.md)
   - Existing project comprehensive documentation
   - Format: Markdown reflecting actual codebase state

4. **Research Prompts**
   - Structured technical research prompts
   - Format: Markdown

5. **Checklist Validation Reports**
   - Architecture quality assessment
   - Format: Structured report with executive summary, section analysis, risk assessment

### File Naming Conventions

- Architecture documents: `docs/architecture.md`
- Frontend architecture: `docs/ui-architecture.md` or `docs/frontend-architecture.md` or `docs/fe-architecture.md`
- Brownfield documentation: `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` or `docs/project-architecture.md`
- Sharded architecture: `docs/architecture/` folder with component files

### Output Locations

All architecture outputs are stored in the `docs/` folder at the project root.

### Section Update Permissions

Architecture documents do not have strict section ownership like some other document types. The Architect is the primary owner of all sections, with the following collaboration patterns:

- **Architect**: Creates and owns all architecture sections
- **Dev Agent**: May reference and implement based on architecture
- **QA Agent**: Validates implementation against architecture
- **PO Agent**: Validates architecture alignment with PRD during checklist execution

---

## 7. Integration Points

### Handoffs to Other Agents

1. **To UX Expert (Sally)**:
   - After backend architecture created for projects with UI
   - Handoff includes reference to architecture.md
   - UX Expert creates front-end-spec.md
   - Then Architect creates frontend architecture based on both PRD and front-end-spec

2. **To PM (John)**:
   - Architecture may inform PRD refinements
   - Architect can execute *shard-prd to break down architecture for epic/story creation
   - PM may request architecture validation before story sequencing

3. **To Dev Agent (James)**:
   - Primary consumer of architecture documents
   - Dev agent implements stories based on architectural guidance
   - Architecture coding standards are extracted and loaded by dev agent
   - Dev agent follows patterns, tech stack, and conventions defined in architecture

4. **To QA Agent (Quinn)**:
   - QA validates implementation against architecture
   - Architecture test strategy informs QA's test design
   - QA may reference security, performance, and quality requirements from architecture

5. **To PO Agent (Sarah)**:
   - PO may request Architect to execute checklist as part of master validation
   - PO validates architecture alignment with PRD
   - Architecture informs story readiness assessment

### Shared Artifacts

1. **docs/architecture.md** - Primary shared artifact:
   - Read by: Dev, QA, PO, SM
   - Created by: Architect
   - Purpose: Technical implementation blueprint

2. **docs/frontend-architecture.md** - Frontend-specific shared artifact:
   - Read by: Dev, UX Expert, QA
   - Created by: Architect
   - Purpose: Frontend implementation patterns

3. **docs/prd.md** - Input artifact from PM:
   - Read by: Architect
   - Created by: PM
   - Purpose: Product requirements drive architectural decisions

4. **docs/front-end-spec.md** - Input artifact from UX Expert:
   - Read by: Architect
   - Created by: UX Expert
   - Purpose: UI/UX requirements inform frontend architecture

### Workflow Dependencies

- **Architect depends on**:
  - PM creating PRD first (docs/prd.md is prerequisite)
  - UX Expert creating front-end-spec (for frontend architecture)
  - User providing existing documentation (for brownfield workflows)

- **Other agents depend on Architect**:
  - Dev agent needs architecture before implementing stories
  - QA agent uses architecture for validation criteria
  - Frontend code generators (v0, Lovable) need frontend architecture

---

## 8. Special Features

### 1. Holistic Full-Stack Capability

Winston is the ONLY agent that creates comprehensive architecture spanning frontend, backend, infrastructure, and operations. The agent has 4 different template options to match different project scenarios:

- **architecture-tmpl.yaml**: Backend-focused for services/APIs
- **fullstack-architecture-tmpl.yaml**: Unified frontend + backend in single document
- **front-end-architecture-tmpl.yaml**: Detailed frontend-specific architecture
- **brownfield-architecture-tmpl.yaml**: Existing project enhancement architecture

### 2. Template-Driven Architecture Creation

All architecture workflows use the **create-doc.md** task with YAML templates. This provides:

- **Structured elicitation**: Section-by-section guidance
- **Mandatory validation points**: elicit=true sections require user feedback
- **Consistent format**: All architectures follow same structure
- **Advanced elicitation methods**: 1-9 numbered options from data/elicitation-methods.md
- **Rationale documentation**: Every decision documented with trade-offs and reasoning

### 3. Tech Stack as Single Source of Truth

The Tech Stack section in architecture templates is designated as the **DEFINITIVE** technology selection. This is emphasized with:

- "This table is the single source of truth - all other docs must reference these choices"
- Explicit user approval required for each technology selection
- Exact version pinning (avoid "latest")
- Frontend architecture MUST synchronize with main architecture tech stack

This prevents technology misalignment across documents.

### 4. AI Agent Implementation Focus

Winston is uniquely designed to create architectures that AI agents can implement:

- **Section 9 of architect-checklist**: "AI Agent Implementation Suitability"
  - Modularity for AI agents
  - Clarity & predictability
  - Implementation guidance
  - Error prevention & handling

- **Coding Standards Section**: "These standards are MANDATORY for AI agents"
  - Minimal but critical rules
  - Project-specific conventions
  - Gotchas that prevent bad code
  - Standards extracted to separate file for dev agent

- **Component Sizing**: Architecture designed for AI agent-sized implementation units

### 5. Brownfield Project Documentation

Winston has specialized capability for documenting existing codebases through **document-project.md** task:

- **Reality-based documentation**: Documents what EXISTS, including technical debt
- **PRD-focused approach**: If PRD provided, focuses docs on relevant areas only
- **Enhancement impact analysis**: Shows exactly what needs to change
- **References over duplication**: Links to actual files rather than duplicating content
- **Practical for AI agents**: Enables AI development on brownfield projects

This is unique among agents and addresses the "AI agents need to understand existing code" problem.

### 6. Comprehensive 10-Section Validation Checklist

The **architect-checklist.md** is the most comprehensive quality validation framework in BMad:

- **441 lines**, 10 major sections
- **Evidence-based validation**: Requires citing specific document sections
- **Risk assessment mindset**: "What could go wrong?"
- **Frontend-aware**: Skips frontend sections for backend-only projects
- **AI implementation suitability**: Dedicated section for AI agent readiness
- **Actionable recommendations**: Must-fix, should-fix, nice-to-have categorization

### 7. Deep Research Prompt Generation

Winston can generate structured research prompts for technical investigation:

- **9 research type options**: Product validation, market, competitive, technology, etc.
- **Structured methodology**: Objectives, questions, methods, deliverables
- **Collaborative development**: Works with user to refine prompt
- **Integration with architecture**: Research informs architectural decisions

### 8. Starter Template Discovery

All architecture templates include **starter template discovery** section:

- Identifies if project uses starter template or boilerplate
- Analyzes starter to understand pre-configured choices
- Aligns architecture with starter's patterns and constraints
- Suggests appropriate starters if none selected

This prevents architecture from conflicting with starter template decisions.

### 9. Platform-First Fullstack Approach

Fullstack architecture template uses platform-first design:

- **Platform selection section**: Vercel+Supabase, AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Deployment-aware architecture**: Architecture considers hosting platform
- **Monorepo emphasis**: Modern fullstack apps favor monorepo structure
- **Shared TypeScript types**: Frontend and backend share types from packages/shared/

### 10. Continuous Validation for Brownfield

Brownfield architecture template enforces continuous validation:

- "Based on my analysis of your existing system, I recommend [decision] because [evidence]. Does this align with your system's reality?"
- Mandatory validation checkpoints at each major decision
- Evidence-based recommendations required (no assumptions)
- Deep analysis mandate before any architectural suggestions

This prevents the common problem of AI suggesting architectures that conflict with existing systems.

---

## 9. Key Architectural Patterns and Conventions

### Architecture Document Structure

All architecture documents follow consistent structure:

1. **Introduction** - Scope, purpose, relationship to other documents
2. **High Level Architecture** - Overview, patterns, diagrams
3. **Tech Stack** - DEFINITIVE technology selections (single source of truth)
4. **Data Models** - Conceptual models before schema
5. **Components** - Logical components with responsibilities
6. **APIs/Integrations** - External and internal APIs
7. **Core Workflows** - Sequence diagrams for critical flows
8. **Database Schema** - Concrete schema definitions
9. **Source Tree** - Project structure
10. **Infrastructure/Deployment** - IaC, CI/CD, environments
11. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error strategy
12. **Coding Standards** - MANDATORY minimal standards for AI
13. **Testing Strategy** - Testing philosophy and organization
14. **Security** - Security requirements across all layers
15. **Checklist Results** - Architecture validation report
16. **Next Steps** - Handoff guidance

### Technology Selection Process

Winston follows systematic technology selection:

1. **Review PRD technical assumptions** and technical-preferences.md
2. **For each category, present 2-3 viable options** with pros/cons
3. **Make clear recommendation** based on project needs
4. **Get explicit user approval** for each selection
5. **Document exact versions** (avoid "latest")
6. **This table is the single source of truth** - all other docs reference these choices

### Elicitation Pattern

For sections with `elicit: true`:

1. **Present content** drafted according to section instruction
2. **Provide detailed rationale** explaining trade-offs, assumptions, decisions
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9**:
   - Option 1: Always "Proceed to next section"
   - Options 2-9: Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods.md
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user input
5. **Execute elicitation method** if user selects 2-9
6. **Refine content** based on feedback

### YOLO Mode vs Interactive Mode

- **Interactive Mode (default)**: Section-by-section with mandatory elicitation
- **YOLO Mode**: Process all sections at once, present complete document
- **Toggle**: User can type `*yolo` or `#yolo` to switch modes
- **Use case**: YOLO for experienced users with clear vision, Interactive for quality assurance

### Coding Standards Philosophy

"These standards are MANDATORY for AI agents. Work with user to define ONLY the critical rules needed to prevent bad code. Explain that:

1. This section directly controls AI developer behavior
2. Keep it minimal - assume AI knows general best practices
3. Focus on project-specific conventions and gotchas
4. Overly detailed standards bloat context and slow development
5. Standards will be extracted to separate file for dev agent use"

Avoid obvious rules like "use SOLID principles" - focus on project-specific requirements.

### Brownfield Documentation Principles

1. **Document REALITY, not aspirations** - Include technical debt, workarounds, constraints
2. **Reference files, don't duplicate** - Link to actual files rather than copying content
3. **PRD-focused approach** - If PRD provided, document only relevant areas
4. **Enhancement impact analysis** - Show exactly what needs to change
5. **Practical for AI agents** - Enable AI development on existing code

### Reasoning Engine Workflows

Several Architect workflows would benefit from Reasoning Engine implementation:

**create-architecture Workflow**:
```python
from google.cloud import reasoning_engine, storage, firestore

class CreateArchitectureWorkflow:
    """
    Reasoning Engine workflow for architecture creation.
    Implements template-driven architecture generation with elicitation.
    """

    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.firestore = firestore.Client()
        self.storage = storage.Client()

    def execute(self, project_id: str, template_type: str) -> dict:
        """Main execution flow."""

        # Step 1: Load prerequisites
        prd = self.load_artifact(project_id, 'prd')
        config = self.load_core_config(project_id)
        template = self.load_template(template_type)

        # Step 2: Select appropriate template
        template_map = {
            'backend': 'architecture-tmpl.yaml',
            'fullstack': 'fullstack-architecture-tmpl.yaml',
            'frontend': 'front-end-architecture-tmpl.yaml',
            'brownfield': 'brownfield-architecture-tmpl.yaml'
        }

        # Step 3: Process template sections
        architecture = {}
        for section in template['sections']:
            if self.should_skip_section(section, prd):
                continue

            # Draft section content
            section_content = self.draft_section(
                section, prd, architecture
            )

            # Elicit feedback if required
            if section.get('elicit', False):
                section_content = self.elicit_feedback(
                    section, section_content
                )

            architecture[section['id']] = section_content

        # Step 4: Execute checklist
        checklist_results = self.execute_checklist(
            project_id, architecture
        )

        architecture['checklist_results'] = checklist_results

        # Step 5: Save architecture document
        self.save_artifact(
            project_id, 'architecture', architecture
        )

        return {
            "architecture": architecture,
            "checklist_results": checklist_results,
            "status": "complete"
        }
```

**document-project Workflow**:
```python
class DocumentProjectWorkflow:
    """
    Reasoning Engine workflow for brownfield project documentation.
    """

    def execute(self, project_id: str, codebase_path: str) -> dict:
        """Main execution flow."""

        # Step 1: Check for PRD (focus documentation if exists)
        prd = self.load_artifact_optional(project_id, 'prd')
        scope = self.determine_scope(prd) if prd else 'comprehensive'

        # Step 2: Analyze existing project
        project_analysis = self.analyze_codebase(codebase_path, scope)

        # Step 3: Generate documentation
        documentation = self.generate_brownfield_docs(
            project_analysis, prd, scope
        )

        # Step 4: Enhancement impact analysis (if PRD provided)
        if prd:
            impact = self.analyze_enhancement_impact(
                project_analysis, prd
            )
            documentation['enhancement_impact'] = impact

        # Step 5: Save documentation
        self.save_artifact(
            project_id, 'brownfield-architecture', documentation
        )

        return {
            "documentation": documentation,
            "scope": scope,
            "status": "complete"
        }
```
