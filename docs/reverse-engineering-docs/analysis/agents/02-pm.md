## 5. Workflows

### 5.1 Greenfield PRD Creation (`*create-prd`)

**Objective**: Create comprehensive Product Requirements Document from Project Brief

**Process Flow**:

1. **Pre-Work Check**:
   - Ask if Project Brief exists
   - If NO: STRONGLY recommend creating one first (provides essential foundation)
   - If YES: Review and use it to inform PRD
   - If user insists on PRD without brief: Gather foundation info during Goals section

2. **Mode Selection**:
   - Interactive Mode: Section-by-section collaboration with elicitation
   - YOLO Mode: Generate complete draft for review

3. **Section 1: Goals and Background Context**:
   - Extract goals from Project Brief (bullet list of desired outcomes)
   - Summarize background context (1-2 paragraphs on what this solves and why)
   - Create Change Log table
   - Purpose: Determine what is and isn't in scope for MVP

4. **Section 2: Requirements** (ELICIT: TRUE):
   - Draft Functional Requirements (FR prefix, numbered)
   - Draft Non-Functional Requirements (NFR prefix, numbered)
   - Each requirement: testable, specific, user-value focused
   - Present with detailed rationale
   - MANDATORY 1-9 elicitation options
   - Examples: "FR6: AI duplicate detection", "NFR1: AWS free-tier limits"

5. **Section 3: UI Design Goals** (ELICIT: TRUE, conditional on UI requirements):
   - Pre-fill all subsections with educated guesses from context
   - Present complete rendered section to user
   - Clearly indicate where assumptions were made
   - Ask targeted questions for unclear elements
   - Subsections:
     - Overall UX Vision
     - Key Interaction Paradigms
     - Core Screens and Views (conceptual high-level)
     - Accessibility (None/WCAG AA/WCAG AAA/Custom)
     - Branding (style guides, design requirements)
     - Target Platforms (Web/Mobile/Desktop/Cross-Platform)
   - Focus: Product vision and user goals (NOT detailed UI spec)

6. **Section 4: Technical Assumptions** (ELICIT: TRUE):
   - Check for `.bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.yaml` to pre-populate
   - Ask user about: languages, frameworks, templates, libraries, APIs, deployment
   - Offer guidance based on project goals and MVP scope
   - Document ALL choices with rationale
   - These become constraints for Architect - be specific and complete
   - Subsections:
     - Repository Structure (Monorepo/Polyrepo/Multi-repo)
     - Service Architecture (Monolith/Microservices/Serverless) - CRITICAL
     - Testing Requirements (Unit only/Unit+Integration/Full pyramid) - CRITICAL
     - Additional Technical Assumptions (capture throughout process)

7. **Section 5: Epic List** (ELICIT: TRUE):
   - Present high-level list of all epics for approval
   - Each epic: title + 1 sentence goal statement
   - **CRITICAL SEQUENCING RULES**:
     - Logically sequential following agile best practices
     - Each epic delivers significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment
     - Epic 1: Foundation + infrastructure + initial functionality (even simple)
     - Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics
     - Err on fewer epics (larger, cohesive increments)
     - Cross-cutting concerns flow through epics (not final stories)
   - User reviews overall structure before diving into details

8. **Section 6: Epic Details** (ELICIT: TRUE, repeatable per epic):
   - After epic list approved, present each epic with all stories
   - Epic Goal: 2-3 sentences describing objective and value
   - **CRITICAL STORY SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS**:
     - Stories MUST be logically sequential within epic
     - Each story is "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality
     - No story depends on later story/epic work
     - Identify direct prerequisite stories
     - Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW (leave technical details to Architect)
     - Each story delivers clear user/business value
     - Size for AI agent execution: 2-4 hour sessions, focused, self-contained
     - If complex, break down further while maintaining vertical slice

   - Story Structure (repeatable per story):
     ```
     As a {{user_type}},
     I want {{action}},
     so that {{benefit}}.

     Acceptance Criteria:
     1. {{criterion}} - precisely define "done" functionally
     2. {{criterion}} - unambiguous, testable
     3. {{criterion}} - include critical NFRs
     4. {{criterion}} - consider local testability for backend
     5. {{criterion}} - specify UI/UX requirements
     ```

9. **Section 7: Checklist Results Report**:
   - Offer to output full PRD before checklist
   - Once user confirms, execute `pm-checklist.md`

10. **Section 8: Next Steps**:
    - **UX Expert Prompt**: Short handoff to create UI architecture using PRD
    - **Architect Prompt**: Short handoff to create architecture using PRD
    - Clear, concise instructions for next agents

**Output**: `docs/prd.md`

**Post-PRD Workflow**:
- User reviews complete PRD

- Handoff to Architect for architecture design
- Eventually: `*shard-prd` to prepare for development phase

---

### 5.2 Brownfield PRD Creation (`*create-brownfield-prd`)

**Objective**: Create PRD for significant enhancements to existing systems

**Process Flow**:

1. **CRITICAL: Scope Assessment**:
   - Assess enhancement complexity upfront
   - If simple feature/bug fix completable in 1-2 sessions: STOP
   - Recommend: "For simpler changes, use brownfield-create-epic or brownfield-create-story"
   - This PRD is for substantial enhancements requiring architectural planning

2. **Project Context Determination**:
   - Determine if in IDE with project loaded vs user providing info
   - Check for existing documentation in `docs/` folder
   - If insufficient: Recommend running `document-project` task first
   - **Deep Assessment Required**: Must analyze actual project before ANY suggestions

3. **Section 1: Intro Project Analysis and Context**:

   **A. Existing Project Overview**:
   - Check if `document-project` analysis already performed
   - If YES: Reference that output (path)
   - If NO: Perform IDE-based analysis or gather user-provided info
   - Extract current state from document-project "High Level Architecture" section
   - Brief description: what project does, primary purpose

   **B. Available Documentation Analysis**:
   - If document-project run: Note available, list key docs, skip missing doc check
   - Otherwise check for:
     - Tech Stack Documentation
     - Source Tree/Architecture
     - Coding Standards
     - API Documentation
     - External API Documentation
     - UX/UI Guidelines
     - Technical Debt Documentation

     - New Feature Addition
     - Major Feature Modification
     - Integration with New Systems
     - Performance/Scalability Improvements
     - UI/UX Overhaul
     - Technology Stack Upgrade
     - Bug Fix and Stability Improvements
     - Other
   - Enhancement Description: 2-3 sentences of what user wants
   - Impact Assessment: Minimal/Moderate/Significant/Major impact

   **D. Goals and Background Context**:
   - Bullet list of desired outcomes
   - 1-2 paragraphs: why needed, what problem solved, how fits with existing
   - Change Log table

   **CRITICAL CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL**:
   - Throughout analysis, explicitly confirm understanding with user
   - For every assumption: "Based on my analysis, I understand that [assumption]. Is this correct?"
   - DO NOT proceed with recommendations until user validates understanding

4. **Section 2: Requirements** (ELICIT: TRUE):
   - Draft based on validated understanding of existing project
   - Before presenting: "These requirements are based on my understanding of your existing system. Please review carefully and confirm they align with your project's reality."

   **A. Functional Requirements** (FR prefix):
   - Example: "FR1: Existing Todo List will integrate with new AI service without breaking current functionality"

   **B. Non-Functional Requirements** (NFR prefix):
   - Include constraints from existing system
   - Example: "NFR1: Enhancement must maintain existing performance and not exceed memory by >20%"

   **C. Compatibility Requirements** (CR prefix) - CRITICAL FOR BROWNFIELD:
   - CR1: Existing API compatibility
   - CR2: Database schema compatibility
   - CR3: UI/UX consistency
   - CR4: Integration compatibility

- Document-project integration
- Compatibility requirements as first-class concern
- Integration strategy documentation
- Existing pattern adherence

---

### 5.3 PRD Sharding Workflow (`*shard-prd`)

**Objective**: Split completed PRD into epic/story folder structure for development phase

**Process Flow**:

1. **Check Configuration**:
   - Read `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
   - Check `markdownExploder` setting (true/false)

2. **Method 1: Automatic Sharding** (if `markdownExploder: true`):
   - Attempt to run: `md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd`
   - If success: Inform user and STOP
   - If command fails:
     - Inform: "markdownExploder enabled but md-tree command not available"
     - Options:
       1. Install: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`
       2. Set `markdownExploder: false` in config
     - STOP - do not proceed with manual sharding

3. **Method 2: Manual Sharding** (if `markdownExploder: false` or user chooses):
   - Inform about automatic option benefits
   - Proceed with manual process

4. **Manual Sharding Process**:

   **A. Identify Document and Target Location**:
   - Source: `docs/prd.md` (or user-provided path)
   - Target: Create `docs/prd/` folder

   **B. Parse and Extract Sections**:
   - Read entire document content
   - Identify all level 2 sections (## headings)
   - For each level 2 section:
     - Extract heading and ALL content until next level 2
     - Include all subsections, code blocks, diagrams, lists, tables
     - **CRITICAL**: Understand markdown context
       - ## inside code block is NOT a section header
       - Capture complete fenced code blocks (including closing ```)
       - Preserve Mermaid diagrams completely
       - Handle nested markdown elements

   **C. Create Individual Files**:
   - Generate filename: lowercase-dash-case from heading
     - Remove special characters
     - Replace spaces with dashes
     - Example: "## Tech Stack" → `tech-stack.md`
   - Adjust heading levels:
     - Level 2 becomes Level 1 (## → #)
     - Level 3 becomes Level 2 (### → ##)
     - Level 4 becomes Level 3 (#### → ###)
     - And so on...
   - Write adjusted content to new file

   **D. Create Index File**:
   - `docs/prd/index.md`
   - Contains:
     - Original level 1 heading
     - Content before first level 2 section
     - Links to all sharded files:
       ```markdown
       # Original Document Title

       [Introduction content]

       ## Sections

       - [Section Name 1](./section-name-1.md)
       - [Section Name 2](./section-name-2.md)
       ...
       ```

   **E. Preserve Special Content**:
   - Code blocks: Complete with language and closing backticks
   - Mermaid diagrams: Complete syntax
   - Tables: Proper markdown formatting
   - Lists: Indentation and nesting
   - Inline code: Backticks preserved
   - Links and references: All markdown links intact
   - Template markup: {{placeholders}} preserved exactly

5. **Validation**:
   - Verify all sections extracted
   - Check no content lost
   - Ensure heading levels adjusted properly
   - Confirm all files created successfully

6. **Report Results**:
   ```
   Document sharded successfully:
   - Source: docs/prd.md
   - Destination: docs/prd/
   - Files created: [count]
   - Sections:
     - epic-1-foundation.md: "Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure"
     - epic-2-core-entities.md: "Epic 2: Core Business Entities"
     ...
   ```

**Output**: `docs/prd/` folder with index.md and individual epic/story files

**Purpose**: Prepares PRD structure for Story Manager (SM) agent to create detailed stories during development phase

### 5.6 Course Correction Workflow (`*correct-course`)

**Objective**: Navigate changes, pivots, or issues that arise during development

**When to Use**:
- Significant change triggers that affect project direction
- Technical dead-ends or limitations discovered
- Newly discovered requirements
- Failed/abandoned stories needing new approach
- Fundamental misunderstanding of requirements revealed

**When NOT to Use**:
- Minor adjustments within a story
- Small bug fixes during implementation

**Process Flow**:

1. **Initial Setup & Mode Selection**:
   - Acknowledge task initiation
   - Verify change trigger and user's explanation of issue/impact
   - Confirm access to: PRD, Epics/Stories, Architecture, UI/UX Specs, change-checklist
   - Establish Interaction Mode:
     - **Incremental (Default & Recommended)**: Work through checklist section-by-section, discussing findings and drafting changes collaboratively
     - **YOLO Mode (Batch Processing)**: Conduct batched analysis, present consolidated findings and proposals for broader review

2. **Execute Checklist Analysis** (Sections 1-4 of change-checklist):

   **Section 1: Understand the Trigger & Context**:
   - [ ] Identify Triggering Story: Clearly identify story(ies) revealing issue
   - [ ] Define the Issue: Articulate core problem precisely
     - Technical limitation/dead-end?
     - Newly discovered requirement?
     - Fundamental misunderstanding?
     - Necessary pivot based on feedback?
     - Failed/abandoned story needing new approach?
   - [ ] Assess Initial Impact: Describe immediate consequences
   - [ ] Gather Evidence: Logs, errors, feedback, analysis supporting issue

   **Section 2: Epic Impact Assessment**:
   - [ ] Analyze Current Epic:
     - Can epic still be completed?
     - Does epic need modification (story changes, additions, removals)?
     - Should epic be abandoned or redefined?
   - [ ] Analyze Future Epics:
     - Review all remaining planned epics
     - Does issue require changes to planned stories in future epics?
     - Does issue invalidate any future epics?
     - Does issue necessitate new epics?
     - Should order/priority of future epics change?
   - [ ] Summarize Epic Impact: Overall effect on project's epic structure and flow

   **Section 3: Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis**:
   - [ ] Review PRD:
     - Conflict with core goals or requirements?
     - PRD needs clarification or updates?
   - [ ] Review Architecture Document:
     - Conflict with documented architecture (components, patterns, tech)?
     - Specific components/diagrams/sections impacted?
     - Technology list needs updating?
     - Data models or schemas need revision?
     - External API integrations affected?
   - [ ] Review Frontend Spec (if applicable):
     - Conflict with FE architecture, component library, UI/UX?
     - Specific FE components or user flows impacted?
   - [ ] Review Other Artifacts:
     - Deployment scripts, IaC, monitoring setup, etc.
   - [ ] Summarize Artifact Impact: List all artifacts requiring updates and nature of changes

   **Section 4: Path Forward Evaluation**:
   - [ ] **Option 1: Direct Adjustment / Integration**:
     - Can issue be addressed by modifying/adding future stories?
     - Define scope and nature of adjustments
     - Assess feasibility, effort, and risks
   - [ ] **Option 2: Potential Rollback**:
     - Would reverting completed stories significantly simplify issue?
     - Identify specific stories/commits to consider
     - Assess rollback effort
     - Assess rollback impact (lost work, data implications)
     - Compare net benefit/cost vs Direct Adjustment
   - [ ] **Option 3: PRD MVP Review & Potential Re-scoping**:
     - Is original PRD MVP still achievable?
     - Does MVP scope need reduction (removing features/epics)?
     - Do core MVP goals need modification?
     - Are alternative approaches needed?
     - **Extreme Case**: Does issue necessitate fundamental replan or PRD V2?
   - [ ] **Select Recommended Path**: Based on evaluation, agree on most viable path

3. **Draft Proposed Changes** (Iteratively or Batched):
   - Identify specific project artifacts requiring updates
   - **Draft proposed changes directly and explicitly**:
     - Revising user story text, acceptance criteria, or priority
     - Adding, removing, reordering, or splitting stories within epics
     - Proposing modified architecture diagram snippets
     - Updating technology lists, configuration details, PRD/Architecture sections
     - Drafting new supporting artifacts if necessary
   - If Incremental Mode: Discuss and refine edits as drafted
   - If YOLO Mode: Compile all edits for next step

4. **Generate "Sprint Change Proposal" with Edits**:
   - Synthesize complete change-checklist analysis and proposed edits
   - Structure per Section 5 of change-checklist:
     - **Analysis Summary**: Concise overview of issue, impact, rationale for chosen path
     - **Specific Proposed Edits**: For each affected artifact, show exact changes
       - "Change Story X.Y from: [old text] To: [new text]"
       - "Add new Acceptance Criterion to Story A.B: [new AC]"
       - "Update Section 3.2 of Architecture Document as follows: [new/modified text or diagram]"
   - Present complete draft to user for final review and feedback
   - Incorporate final adjustments

5. **Finalize & Determine Next Steps**:
   - Obtain explicit user approval for Sprint Change Proposal
   - Provide finalized document to user
   - **Determine Next Steps Based on Approved Changes**:
     - If edits can be implemented directly: "Correct Course Task complete. User can proceed with implementing/logging changes. Suggest handoff to PO/SM agent for backlog organization."
     - If fundamental replan required: "Next step involves engaging primary PM or Architect agents, using Sprint Change Proposal as critical input for deeper replanning."

**Output**: "Sprint Change Proposal" document (markdown format) containing:
- Summary of change-checklist analysis
- Specific, clearly drafted proposed edits for all affected artifacts

**Key Principles**:
- Changes are opportunities to improve, not failures
- Handle professionally and constructively
- User buy-in is critical - they must understand and approve
- Minimize wasted work while adapting to new realities

All PM artifacts created in the `docs/` directory at project root:
```
project-root/
└── docs/
    ├── prd.md (before sharding)
    ├── prd/ (after sharding)
    │   ├── index.md
    │   ├── epic-1-foundation.md
    │   ├── epic-2-core-entities.md

    │   └── enhancement-epic.md
    └── stories/ (brownfield)
        └── small-feature.md
```

### Section Update Permissions

PRD templates define agent-specific section ownership and editing permissions:

**Agent Permission Fields** (in template YAML):
- `owner`: Agent role that initially creates/populates the section
- `editors`: Array of agent roles allowed to modify the section
- `readonly`: Boolean indicating section cannot be modified after creation

**Permission Enforcement**:
- When processing sections, PM notes which agent role owns/edits each section
- Generated documents include notes indicating responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

**Typical PM Ownership**:
- Goals and Background Context
- Requirements (Functional, Non-Functional, Compatibility)
- Epic List and Epic Details
- UI Design Goals (created by PM, refined by UX Expert)
- Technical Assumptions (created by PM, validated by Architect)

**Shared/Downstream Sections**:
- Checklist Results (PM executes, but based on checklist framework)
- Next Steps (handoff instructions to other agents)

## 8. Special Features

### 1. Interactive PRD Creation with Mandatory Elicitation

**Unique Capability**: Section-by-section collaborative PRD creation with mandatory user interaction points

**Elicitation Workflow**:
- When template section has `elicit: true`, this is HARD STOP requiring user interaction
- PM MUST:
  1. Present section content
  2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions)
  3. STOP and present numbered options 1-9
  4. WAIT for user response before proceeding
- NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format
- Creating content for `elicit=true` sections without user interaction violates workflow

**Advanced Elicitation Integration**:
- Options 2-9 selected from `data/elicitation-methods`
- Methods vary by context (content type, complexity, stakeholder needs, risk)
- Always includes core methods: Expand/Contract, Critique, Identify Risks, Assess Alignment
- User can provide direct feedback or select method
- Iterative refinement continues until user satisfied

**Key Differentiator**: This prevents "dump-and-done" PRDs, ensuring quality through collaborative refinement

### 2. Dual-Mode Operation (Interactive vs YOLO)

**Interactive Mode** (Default):
- Section-by-section collaborative drafting
- Detailed rationale provided for each section
- Mandatory elicitation for `elicit: true` sections (cannot skip)
- User can provide direct feedback or select elicitation methods
- Slower but higher quality and alignment

**YOLO Mode** (toggled with `*yolo`):
- Generates complete document draft in one pass
- User reviews and refines entire document after generation
- Faster but less collaborative
- Still maintains quality through post-generation refinement
- Still uses elicitation, just batched at end

**Toggle Flexibility**: User can switch modes mid-workflow as needed

### 3. PM Checklist Validation Framework

**Comprehensive Quality Gate**: 9-category validation before PRD completion

**Validation Categories** (9 total):
1. Problem Definition & Context (5 items)
2. MVP Scope Definition (3 items)
3. User Experience Requirements (3 items)
4. Functional Requirements (3 items)
5. Non-Functional Requirements (3 items)
6. Epic & Story Structure (3 items)
7. Technical Guidance (3 items)
8. Cross-Functional Requirements (3 items)
9. Clarity & Communication (2 items)

**Execution Modes**:
- Section-by-section (interactive): Review each category, present findings, get confirmation
- All-at-once (comprehensive): Complete full analysis, present comprehensive report

**Output Report Structure**:
- Executive Summary (completeness %, MVP appropriateness, readiness assessment, critical gaps)
- Category Analysis Table (PASS 90%+, PARTIAL 60-89%, FAIL <60%)
- Top Issues by Priority (BLOCKERS, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- MVP Scope Assessment
- Technical Readiness
- Recommendations

**Final Decision**: READY FOR ARCHITECT or NEEDS REFINEMENT

**Key Differentiator**: Ensures PRD quality before expensive architecture/development work begins

### 4. Brownfield-Specific Capabilities

**Scope Assessment Protocol**:
- Mandatory upfront assessment of enhancement complexity
- Prevents over-engineering small changes
- Three-tier approach:
  - Small (single story) → `*create-story`
  - Medium (1-3 stories) → `*create-epic`
  - Large (multiple coordinated) → `*create-brownfield-prd`

**Document-Project Integration**:
- Checks for existing brownfield architecture analysis
- Uses existing documentation to inform PRD
- Recommends running document-project if critical docs missing
- References analysis sources explicitly

**Confirmation Protocol**:
- For every assumption about existing project: "Based on my analysis, I understand that [assumption]. Is this correct?"
- DO NOT proceed with recommendations until user validates understanding
- Prevents costly misunderstandings about existing system

**Compatibility Requirements** (First-Class Concern):
- Dedicated section with CR prefix
- CR1: Existing API compatibility
- CR2: Database schema compatibility
- CR3: UI/UX consistency
- CR4: Integration compatibility
- Explicit compatibility checks in every story

**Integration Strategy Documentation**:
- Database Integration Strategy
- API Integration Strategy
- Frontend Integration Strategy
- Testing Integration Strategy
- Defines how enhancement fits existing architecture

**Key Differentiator**: Treats brownfield as distinct workflow, not afterthought

### 5. Course Correction with Change Checklist

**Structured Change Navigation**: Systematic approach to handling significant changes during development

**Change-Checklist Framework** (6 sections):
1. Understand the Trigger & Context
2. Epic Impact Assessment (current and future epics)
3. Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis (PRD, Architecture, Frontend Spec)
4. Path Forward Evaluation (3 options: adjust, rollback, re-scope)
5. Sprint Change Proposal Components
6. Final Review & Handoff

**Path Evaluation Options**:
- Option 1: Direct Adjustment/Integration (modify/add future stories)
- Option 2: Potential Rollback (revert completed stories to simplify)
- Option 3: PRD MVP Review & Re-scoping (reduce scope, modify goals, or replan)

**Sprint Change Proposal Output**:
- Identified Issue Summary
- Epic Impact Summary
- Artifact Adjustment Needs
- Recommended Path Forward with rationale
- PRD MVP Impact
- High-Level Action Plan
- Agent Handoff Plan

**Key Differentiator**: Turns inevitable changes from project chaos into structured, managed adaptations

### 6. Automatic vs Manual PRD Sharding

**Two-Method Approach**:

**Method 1: Automatic** (via markdown-tree-parser):
- Uses `md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd`
- Controlled by `markdownExploder: true` in core-config
- Fast, reliable, handles edge cases automatically
- Recommended approach

**Method 2: Manual** (LLM-driven):
- Fallback when markdown-tree-parser not installed
- PM informs user of automatic option benefits
- LLM performs markdown parsing with context awareness
- Handles code blocks, diagrams, nested content
- More error-prone but functional

**Critical Parsing Logic**:
- Understands markdown context (## inside code block is NOT header)
- Preserves complete fenced code blocks
- Maintains Mermaid diagrams
- Adjusts heading levels appropriately
- Creates index with links to all sections

**Key Differentiator**: Flexibility in tooling while maintaining quality output

### 7. Epic and Story Sequencing Rules

**Critical Sequencing Requirements Built Into Templates**:

**Epic Sequencing** (enforced in Epic List section):
- Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices
- Each epic delivers significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment
- Epic 1: Foundation + infrastructure + initial functionality (even if simple)
- Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics
- Err on fewer epics (larger, cohesive increments)
- Cross-cutting concerns flow through epics (not final stories)

**Story Sequencing** (enforced in Epic Details section):
- Stories MUST be logically sequential within epic
- Each story is "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality
- No story depends on later story/epic work
- Identify direct prerequisite stories explicitly
- Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW

**AI Agent Sizing**:
- Stories sized for AI agent execution: 2-4 hour sessions
- Think "junior developer working focused session"
- Stories must be small, focused, self-contained
- If complex, break down further while maintaining vertical slice

**Key Differentiator**: Embeds agile best practices and AI agent constraints directly into template instructions

### 8. Technical Preferences Integration

**Pre-Population from User Preferences**:
- Checks `.bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.yaml` during PRD creation
- Pre-populates technical assumptions section with user's preferred stack
- Guides consistency across projects
- Reduces repeated technical decision discussions

**Rationale Documentation**:
- For each technical choice, document WHY it fits the project
- These become constraints for Architect
- Ensures technical decisions align with project goals and user preferences

**Key Differentiator**: Learns from user preferences over time, reducing friction in repeated workflows

## 9. Configuration Options

### Agent Customization Field
```yaml
agent:
  customization: null
```

**Note**: The PM agent does not define any custom configuration in the base definition. The `customization` field is set to `null`.

**Customization Override Rule**: If the `agent.customization` field is populated, it ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions in the agent definition.

### Mode Toggles

**YOLO Mode** (`*yolo` command):
- Toggles between Interactive and YOLO (fast-track) modes
- Interactive: Section-by-section with mandatory elicitation
- YOLO: Complete draft generation with post-review refinement
- Applies to template-driven document creation (PRD, Brownfield PRD)

### Template-Specific Workflow Modes

Each template defines its own workflow mode:
- `prd-tmpl.yaml`: `mode: interactive` with `elicitation: advanced-elicitation`
- `brownfield-prd-tmpl.yaml`: `mode: interactive` with `elicitation: advanced-elicitation`

Both PRD templates use interactive mode by default with advanced elicitation support.

### Configuration-Driven Sharding

**markdownExploder Setting** (in core-config.yaml):
- `true`: Uses automatic sharding via `md-tree explode` command
- `false`: Uses manual LLM-driven sharding
- Affects `*shard-prd` workflow behavior

---

## 10. Activation and Initialization

### Activation Instructions

The PM agent follows a strict 4-step activation sequence:

**STEP 1**: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - contains complete persona definition

**STEP 2**: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections

**STEP 3**: Load and read `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting

**STEP 4**: Greet user with name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands

**Critical Rules**:
- DO NOT load any other agent files during activation
- ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request
- The `agent.customization` field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
- When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written (executable workflows)
- Tasks with `elicit=true` require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation
- When listing tasks/templates or presenting options, always show as numbered options list
- STAY IN CHARACTER!
- On activation, ONLY greet, auto-run `*help`, then HALT to await user commands (unless activation included commands in arguments)

### Dependency Loading Strategy

**Lazy Loading**:
- Dependencies loaded on-demand only when commands executed
- NOT pre-loaded during activation (conserves context window)

**File Resolution**:
- Dependencies map to `.bmad-core/{type}/{name}`
- Types: `tasks`, `templates`, `checklists`, `data`, `utils`
- Example: `create-doc.md` → `.bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md`
- Example: `prd-tmpl.yaml` → `.bmad-core/templates/prd-tmpl.yaml`

### Request Resolution

**Flexible Command Matching**:
- Match user requests to commands flexibly
- Examples:
  - "make a new prd" → `*create-prd` → dependencies->tasks->create-doc + dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.yaml
  - "create brownfield epic" → `*create-epic` → dependencies->tasks->brownfield-create-epic.md
  - "shard the prd" → `*shard-prd` → dependencies->tasks->shard-doc.md
- ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match

### Core Configuration Loading

The PM agent loads `core-config.yaml` during activation to understand:
- PRD structure (v3 vs v4, sharded vs embedded)
- Architecture structure (v3 monolithic vs v4 sharded)
- Document locations
- markdownExploder setting (for sharding strategy)
- Developer file preferences

This enables intelligent document handling and appropriate workflow selection based on project configuration.

## 11. Behavioral Constraints and Special Rules

### Critical Workflow Rules

1. **Task Instructions Override Base Constraints**:
   - When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints
   - Tasks are executable workflows, not reference material
   - Interactive workflows with `elicit=true` REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency

2. **Mandatory Elicitation Format**:
   - When template section has `elicit: true`, this is HARD STOP requiring user interaction
   - MUST present section content with detailed rationale
   - MUST STOP and present numbered options 1-9
   - MUST WAIT for user response before proceeding
   - NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format
   - Creating content for `elicit=true` sections without user interaction violates workflow

3. **Stay in Character**:
   - Maintain PM persona throughout interaction
   - Analytical, inquisitive, data-driven, user-focused, pragmatic
   - Exit only when user issues `*exit` command

4. **Ruthless Prioritization**:
   - Challenge every feature's inclusion in MVP
   - Distinguish must-haves from nice-to-haves explicitly
   - Be willing to cut features to ship faster
   - Focus on delivering value, not building everything

5. **Detailed Rationale Requirement**:
   - When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale explaining:
     - Trade-offs and choices made (what chosen over alternatives and why)
     - Key assumptions during drafting
     - Interesting or questionable decisions needing user attention
     - Areas requiring validation

6. **Brownfield Confirmation Protocol**:
   - For every assumption about existing project: "Based on my analysis, I understand that [assumption]. Is this correct?"
   - DO NOT proceed with recommendations until user validates understanding
   - Prevents costly misunderstandings about existing system

### Agent Permissions and File Operations

The PM agent:
- **CAN create** new documents in `docs/` directory
- **CAN read** project files for brownfield analysis
- **CAN modify** PRD and related product documents
- **CANNOT modify** existing code files (read-only access to codebase for analysis)
- **Creates** product planning documents, not implementation artifacts

### Context Management

- Dependencies loaded lazily (on-demand)
- Core configuration loaded at activation
- Project-specific documentation can be loaded by reference in activation arguments
- Keeps context window lean for complex PRD creation tasks

### Numbered Options Protocol

**Universal Interaction Pattern**:
- All selections presented as numbered lists
- Supports simple numeric responses (reduces friction)
- Applied consistently across:
  - Command selection (`*help`)
  - Template selection
  - Elicitation method selection (1-9 format)
  - Change checklist option selection

**Benefits**:
- Faster user decision-making
- Clear, unambiguous selections
- Consistent user experience across PM interactions

- Command routing
- Technical preferences loading

### Integration Considerations

**Web UI Support**:
- PM designed for web UI planning phase (especially Gemini with large context)
- Cost-effective for lengthy PRD creation
- Bundle includes all dependencies for standalone operation
- Documents copied to IDE for development phase

**IDE Integration**:
- Can be used in IDE for brownfield analysis of local codebases
- Better suited for quick brownfield epics/stories
- Immediate file operations and project integration
- Access to actual codebase for analysis

**Transition Points**:
- PM outputs (PRD, sharded structure) serve as input to UX Expert, Architect, and Story Manager
- PRD triggers UX Expert and Architect agent activation
- Sharded PRD enables Story Manager to create detailed stories
- Sprint Change Proposals coordinate cross-agent updates

**Workflow Orchestration**:
- PM typically second agent in greenfield workflow (after Analyst)
- PM can be first agent in brownfield workflow (with document-project)
- PM called back during development for course corrections
- Clear handoff points to downstream agents defined in PRD

## Summary

The **PM Agent (John)** is BMad's product strategy and requirements specialist, serving as the critical bridge between vision (from Analyst) and technical implementation (to Architect and development teams). Through comprehensive PRD creation for both greenfield and brownfield projects, structured epic/story organization, validation frameworks, and course correction capabilities, John transforms high-level product concepts into actionable, validated requirements that guide all downstream development activities.

**Key Strengths**:
- Interactive PRD creation with mandatory elicitation for quality
- Dual-mode operation (interactive vs YOLO) for flexibility
- PM checklist validation framework (9 categories, comprehensive reporting)
- Brownfield-specific capabilities with scope assessment and confirmation protocols
- Course correction with structured change navigation (change-checklist)
- Epic and story sequencing rules embedded in templates (agile best practices)
- Automatic and manual PRD sharding for development preparation
- Technical preferences integration for consistency

**Typical Usage Pattern**:
1. Receive Project Brief from Analyst (or start fresh for brownfield)
2. Create PRD (`*create-prd` or `*create-brownfield-prd`)
3. Execute PM checklist validation
4. Shard PRD for development (`*shard-prd`)
5. Hand off to UX Expert and Architect for design
6. Support course corrections during development (`*correct-course`)
7. Create brownfield epics/stories as needed for smaller work

**ADK Implementation Priority**: Critical (central to planning phase, feeds all downstream work)

**Critical Success Factors**:
- Enforce mandatory elicitation workflow (cannot skip user interaction)
- Implement PM checklist validation rigorously
- Support brownfield confirmation protocol
- Enable flexible mode switching (interactive vs YOLO)
- Integrate with document-project for brownfield analysis
- Ensure sharding preserves all formatting and content
