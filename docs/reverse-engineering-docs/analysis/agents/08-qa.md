**Focus**: Comprehensive quality analysis through test architecture, risk assessment, and advisory gates

---

## 2. Core Principles

The QA agent operates according to ten critical guiding principles:

### 1. Depth As Needed
- **Risk-based depth** - Go deep based on risk signals, stay concise when low risk
- **Adaptive review** - Match analysis depth to story complexity and risk profile
- **Efficient thoroughness** - Comprehensive where it matters, lightweight otherwise
- **Smart escalation** - Auto-escalate to deep review for auth/payment/security, large diffs (>500 lines), missing tests, previous FAIL/CONCERNS gates, >5 acceptance criteria

### 2. Requirements Traceability
- **Map all stories to tests** - Every acceptance criterion must have corresponding test coverage
- **Given-When-Then clarity** - Document test mappings (not test code) with clear GWT patterns
- **Coverage gap identification** - Explicitly identify what's tested and what's missing
- **Traceability matrix** - Create comprehensive requirement-to-test mappings

### 3. Risk-Based Testing
- **Assess and prioritize by probability Ã— impact** - Systematic risk scoring (1-9 scale)
- **Six risk categories** - TECH, SEC, PERF, DATA, BUS, OPS with structured assessment
- **Risk mitigation strategies** - Actionable preventive/detective/corrective measures
- **Risk-driven test focus** - Align test priorities with identified risks

### 4. Quality Attributes
- **Validate NFRs via scenarios** - Security, performance, reliability, maintainability
- **Core four NFRs by default** - Security, performance, reliability, maintainability (can assess others)
- **Evidence-based validation** - PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL with specific findings
- **Unknown targets policy** - Mark as CONCERNS when targets missing (no guessing)

### 5. Testability Assessment
- **Evaluate controllability** - Can we control the inputs?
- **Evaluate observability** - Can we observe the outputs?
- **Evaluate debuggability** - Can we debug failures easily?
- **Test architecture quality** - Appropriate test levels, maintainability, execution time

### 6. Gate Governance
- **Provide clear PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED decisions** with rationale
- **Deterministic gate criteria** - Risk thresholds â†’ NFR statuses â†’ issue severity
- **Advisory (not blocking)** - Teams choose their quality bar
- **Gate file creation** - Standalone YAML files with structured decision data

### 7. Advisory Excellence
- **Educate through documentation** - Learning-focused feedback
- **Never block arbitrarily** - Clear rationale for all decisions
- **Actionable recommendations** - Specific, implementable improvements
- **Active refactoring** - Improve code directly during review when safe and appropriate

### 8. Technical Debt Awareness
- **Identify and quantify debt** - Accumulated shortcuts, missing tests, outdated dependencies
- **Improvement suggestions** - Future vs immediate action items
- **Pragmatic balance** - Distinguish must-fix from nice-to-have

### 9. LLM Acceleration
- **Use LLMs to accelerate thorough yet focused analysis**
- **Systematic frameworks** - Test levels, priorities matrix, risk assessment
- **Consistent methodologies** - Repeatable quality analysis patterns

### 10. Pragmatic Balance
- **Distinguish must-fix from nice-to-have** improvements
- **Risk-based prioritization** - Focus on what matters most
- **Team empowerment** - Advisory guidance, not mandates

### Command Details

#### `*review {story}` - Comprehensive Review Workflow

**Primary workflow** producing both story update and gate file.

**Inputs**:
- `story_id`: e.g., "1.3"
- `story_path`: From `core-config.yaml` â†’ `devStoryLocation`
- `story_title`: Derived from story file H1 if missing
- `story_slug`: Lowercase, hyphenated title

**Prerequisites**:
- Story status must be "Review"
- Developer has completed all tasks and updated File List
- All automated tests are passing

**Review Process - Adaptive Test Architecture**:

1. **Risk Assessment** (Determines Review Depth)
   - Auto-escalate to deep review when:
     - Auth/payment/security files touched
     - No tests added to story
     - Diff > 500 lines
     - Previous gate was FAIL/CONCERNS
     - Story has > 5 acceptance criteria

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**:
   - **Requirements Traceability**: Map each AC to validating tests (GWT documentation, not test code)
   - **Code Quality Review**: Architecture, refactoring opportunities (perform them), duplication, performance, security, best practices
   - **Test Architecture Assessment**: Coverage adequacy, test level appropriateness (unit vs integration vs E2E), design quality, data management, mock usage, edge cases, execution time
   - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Security, performance, reliability, maintainability
   - **Testability Evaluation**: Controllability, observability, debuggability
   - **Technical Debt Identification**: Shortcuts, missing tests, outdated deps, architecture violations

3. **Active Refactoring**:
   - Refactor code where safe and appropriate
   - Run tests to ensure changes don't break functionality
   - Document all changes in QA Results section with clear WHY and HOW
   - Do NOT alter story content beyond QA Results section
   - Do NOT change story Status or File List; recommend next status only

4. **Standards Compliance Check**:
   - Verify adherence to `docs/coding-standards.md`
   - Check compliance with `docs/unified-project-structure.md`
   - Validate testing approach against `docs/testing-strategy.md`

5. **Acceptance Criteria Validation**:
   - Verify each AC is fully implemented
   - Check for missing functionality
   - Validate edge cases are handled

6. **Documentation and Comments**:
   - Verify code is self-documenting where possible
   - Add comments for complex logic if missing
   - Ensure API changes are documented

**Output 1: Update Story File - QA Results Section ONLY**

**CRITICAL**: ONLY authorized to update the "QA Results" section of story file. DO NOT modify any other sections.

**QA Results Anchor Rule**:
- If `## QA Results` doesn't exist, append it at end of file
- If it exists, append a new dated entry below existing entries
- Never edit other sections

evidence:
  tests_reviewed: { count }
  risks_identified: { count }
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3]
    ac_gaps: [4]

nfr_validation:
  security: { status: PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL, notes: '...' }
  performance: { status: PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL, notes: '...' }
  reliability: { status: PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL, notes: '...' }

      refs: ['api/auth/login.ts']
  future: # Can be addressed later
    - action: 'Consider caching'
      refs: ['services/data.ts']
```

**Gate Decision Criteria** (Deterministic - apply in order):

1. **Risk thresholds** (if risk_summary present):
   - If any risk score â‰¥ 9 â†’ Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
   - Else if any score â‰¥ 6 â†’ Gate = CONCERNS

2. **Test coverage gaps** (if trace available):
   - If any P0 test from test-design is missing â†’ Gate = CONCERNS
   - If security/data-loss P0 test missing â†’ Gate = FAIL

3. **Issue severity**:
   - If any `top_issues.severity == high` â†’ Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
   - Else if any `severity == medium` â†’ Gate = CONCERNS

4. **NFR statuses**:
   - If any NFR status is FAIL â†’ Gate = FAIL
   - Else if any NFR status is CONCERNS â†’ Gate = CONCERNS
   - Else â†’ Gate = PASS

- WAIVED only when `waiver.active: true` with reason/approver

**Quality Score Calculation**:
```text
quality_score = 100 - (20 Ã— number of FAILs) - (10 Ã— number of CONCERNS)
Bounded between 0 and 100
```

**Blocking Conditions** (HALT and request clarification):
- Story file is incomplete or missing critical sections
- File List is empty or clearly incomplete
- No tests exist when they were required
- Code changes don't align with story requirements
- Critical architectural issues requiring discussion

#### `*risk-profile {story}` - Risk Assessment Workflow

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive risk assessment matrix using probability Ã— impact analysis.

**Risk Assessment Framework**:

**Six Risk Categories**:
- `TECH`: Technical Risks (architecture complexity, integration, technical debt, scalability, dependencies)
- `SEC`: Security Risks (auth/authz flaws, data exposure, injection, session, cryptographic)
- `PERF`: Performance Risks (response time, throughput, resource exhaustion, query optimization, caching)
- `DATA`: Data Risks (data loss, corruption, privacy violations, compliance, backup/recovery)
- `BUS`: Business Risks (user needs, revenue impact, reputation, regulatory, market timing)
- `OPS`: Operational Risks (deployment failures, monitoring gaps, incident response, documentation, knowledge transfer)

**Risk Scoring**:
- **Probability Levels**: High (3) >70%, Medium (2) 30-70%, Low (1) <30%
- **Impact Levels**: High (3) severe consequences, Medium (2) moderate, Low (1) minor
- **Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact**:
  - 9: Critical Risk (Red)
  - 6: High Risk (Orange)
  - 4: Medium Risk (Yellow)
  - 2-3: Low Risk (Green)
  - 1: Minimal Risk (Blue)

**Output 1: Gate YAML Block** (for pasting into gate file under `risk_summary`):
```yaml
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: X # score 9
    high: Y # score 6
    medium: Z # score 4
    low: W # score 2-3
  highest:
    id: SEC-001
    score: 9
    title: 'XSS on profile form'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Add input sanitization & CSP'
    monitor:
      - 'Add security alerts for auth endpoints'
```

**Output 2: Markdown Report**:
- **Save to**: `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-risk-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
- Contains: Executive Summary, Critical Risks, Risk Distribution, Detailed Risk Register, Risk-Based Testing Strategy, Risk Acceptance Criteria, Monitoring Requirements

**Integration with Quality Gates**:
- Any risk with score â‰¥ 9 â†’ Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
- Else if any score â‰¥ 6 â†’ Gate = CONCERNS
- Else â†’ Gate = PASS
- Unmitigated risks â†’ Document in gate

#### `*test-design {story}` - Test Design Workflow

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive test scenarios with appropriate test level recommendations for story implementation.

**Dependencies**:
- `test-levels-framework.md`: Unit/Integration/E2E decision criteria
- `test-priorities-matrix.md`: P0/P1/P2/P3 classification system

**Process**:
1. **Analyze Story Requirements**: Break down each AC into testable scenarios
2. **Apply Test Level Framework**:
   - **Unit**: Pure logic, algorithms, calculations
   - **Integration**: Component interactions, DB operations
   - **E2E**: Critical user journeys, compliance
3. **Assign Priorities**:
   - **P0**: Revenue-critical, security, compliance
   - **P1**: Core user journeys, frequently used
   - **P2**: Secondary features, admin functions
   - **P3**: Nice-to-have, rarely used
4. **Design Test Scenarios**: Create specific test scenarios with ID, requirement, priority, level, description, justification, risk mitigations
5. **Validate Coverage**: Every AC has test, no duplicate coverage, critical paths have multiple levels, risk mitigations addressed

**Output 1: Test Design Document**:
- **Save to**: `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-test-design-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
- Contains: Test Strategy Overview, Test Scenarios by AC, Risk Coverage, Recommended Execution Order

**Output 2: Gate YAML Block**:
```yaml
test_design:
  scenarios_total: X
  by_level: { unit: Y, integration: Z, e2e: W }
  by_priority: { p0: A, p1: B, p2: C }
  coverage_gaps: []
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Shift left**: Prefer unit over integration, integration over E2E
- **Risk-based**: Focus on what could go wrong
- **Efficient coverage**: Test once at the right level
- **Maintainability**: Consider long-term test maintenance
- **Fast feedback**: Quick tests run first

#### `*trace {story}` - Requirements Traceability Workflow

**Purpose**: Map story requirements to test cases using Given-When-Then patterns for comprehensive traceability.

**IMPORTANT**: Given-When-Then is used here for documenting the mapping between requirements and tests, NOT for writing the actual test code. Tests should follow project testing standards (no BDD syntax in test code).

**Process**:
1. **Extract Requirements**: From ACs, user story, tasks/subtasks, NFRs, edge cases
2. **Map to Test Cases**: Document which tests validate each requirement using GWT
3. **Coverage Analysis**: Evaluate coverage levels (full, partial, none, integration, unit)
4. **Gap Identification**: Document coverage gaps with severity and suggested tests

**Coverage Levels**:
- `full`: Requirement completely tested
- `partial`: Some aspects tested, gaps exist
- `none`: No test coverage found
- `integration`: Covered in integration/e2e tests only
- `unit`: Covered in unit tests only

**Output 1: Gate YAML Block** (for pasting into gate file under `trace`):
```yaml
trace:
  totals: { requirements: X, full: Y, partial: Z, none: W }
  planning_ref: 'qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-test-design-{YYYYMMDD}.md'
  uncovered:
    - ac: 'AC3'
      reason: 'No test found for password reset timing'
  notes: 'See qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md'
```

**Output 2: Traceability Report**:
- **Save to**: `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
- Contains: Coverage Summary, Requirement Mappings (with GWT), Critical Gaps, Test Design Recommendations, Risk Assessment

**Given-When-Then for Mapping** (Not Test Code):
- **Given**: Initial context the test sets up (state/data, user context, system preconditions)
- **When**: Action the test performs (execution, API calls, events)
- **Then**: What the test asserts (expected outcomes, state changes, values)

**Integration with Gates**:
- Critical gaps â†’ FAIL
- Minor gaps â†’ CONCERNS
- Missing P0 tests from test-design â†’ CONCERNS
- Full coverage â†’ PASS contribution

#### `*nfr-assess {story}` - NFR Assessment Workflow

**Purpose**: Quick NFR validation focused on the core four: security, performance, reliability, maintainability.

**Scope Elicitation** (Interactive vs Non-interactive):
- **Interactive mode**: Ask which NFRs to assess
- **Non-interactive mode**: Default to core four (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
- Additional NFRs available: usability, compatibility, portability, functional suitability

**Threshold Check**:
- Look for NFR requirements in story ACs, architecture docs, technical-preferences
- **Interactive mode**: Ask for missing thresholds
- **Non-interactive mode**: Mark as CONCERNS with "Target unknown"

**Deterministic Status Rules**:
- **FAIL**: Any selected NFR has critical gap or target clearly not met
- **CONCERNS**: No FAILs, but any NFR is unknown/partial/missing evidence
- **PASS**: All selected NFRs meet targets with evidence

**Output 1: Gate YAML Block** (ONLY for NFRs actually assessed - no placeholders):
```yaml
nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security: { status: CONCERNS, notes: 'No rate limiting on auth endpoints' }
  performance: { status: PASS, notes: 'Response times < 200ms verified' }
  reliability: { status: PASS, notes: 'Error handling and retries implemented' }
  maintainability: { status: CONCERNS, notes: 'Test coverage at 65%, target is 80%' }
```

**Quality Score Calculation**:
```text
quality_score = 100
- 20 for each FAIL attribute
- 10 for each CONCERNS attribute
Floor at 0, ceiling at 100
```

**Output 2: Brief Assessment Report**:
- **ALWAYS save to**: `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-nfr-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
- Contains: Summary, Critical Issues, Quick Wins

**Assessment Criteria Examples**:

**Security**:
- PASS: Auth implemented, authorization enforced, input validation, no hardcoded secrets
- CONCERNS: Missing rate limiting, weak encryption, incomplete authorization
- FAIL: No authentication, hardcoded credentials, SQL injection vulnerabilities

**Performance**:
- PASS: Meets response time targets, no obvious bottlenecks, reasonable resource usage
- CONCERNS: Close to limits, missing indexes, no caching strategy
- FAIL: Exceeds response time limits, memory leaks, unoptimized queries

**Reliability**:
- PASS: Error handling present, graceful degradation, retry logic where needed
- CONCERNS: Some error cases unhandled, no circuit breakers, missing health checks
- FAIL: No error handling, crashes on errors, no recovery mechanisms

**Maintainability**:
- PASS: Test coverage meets target, code well-structured, documentation present
- CONCERNS: Test coverage below target, some code duplication, missing documentation
- FAIL: No tests, highly coupled code, no documentation

#### `*gate {story}` - Quality Gate Decision Workflow

**Purpose**: Create or update a quality gate decision file for a story based on review findings.

**Gate File Location**: Check `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` for `qa.qaLocation/gates`

**Minimal Required Schema**:
```yaml
schema: 1
story: '{epic}.{story}'
gate: PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL|WAIVED
status_reason: '1-2 sentence explanation of gate decision'
reviewer: 'Quinn'
updated: '{ISO-8601 timestamp}'
top_issues: [] # Empty array if no issues
waiver: { active: false } # Only set active: true if WAIVED
```

**Gate Decision Criteria**:
- **PASS**: All acceptance criteria met, no high-severity issues, test coverage meets standards
- **CONCERNS**: Non-blocking issues present, should be tracked and scheduled, can proceed with awareness
- **FAIL**: Acceptance criteria not met, high-severity issues present, recommend return to InProgress
- **WAIVED**: Issues explicitly accepted, requires approval and reason, proceed despite known issues

**Severity Scale** (FIXED VALUES - NO VARIATIONS):
- `low`: Minor issues, cosmetic problems
- `medium`: Should fix soon, not blocking
- `high`: Critical issues, should block release

**Issue ID Prefixes**:
- `SEC-`: Security issues
- `PERF-`: Performance issues
- `REL-`: Reliability issues
- `TEST-`: Testing gaps
- `MNT-`: Maintainability concerns
- `ARCH-`: Architecture issues
- `DOC-`: Documentation gaps
- `REQ-`: Requirements issues

**Output Requirements**:
1. **ALWAYS** create gate file at: `qa.qaLocation/gates` from `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
2. **ALWAYS** append to story's QA Results section:
   ```text
   Gate: {STATUS} â†’ qa.qaLocation/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml
   ```
3. Keep status_reason to 1-2 sentences maximum
4. Use severity values exactly: `low`, `medium`, or `high`

### Required Data Files (3)

Location: `.bmad-core/data/`

1. **`technical-preferences.md`**
   - Purpose: User-defined preferred patterns and preferences
   - Used by: All agents for understanding project preferences
   - Contains: Custom quality score weights (if defined), NFR thresholds, testing preferences
   - Note: In analyzed framework, file contains "None Listed"

2. **`test-levels-framework.md`**
   - Purpose: Comprehensive guide for determining appropriate test levels (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Used by: `test-design` task for test level decisions
   - Contains:
     - **Unit Tests**: When to use (pure functions, business logic, algorithms, validation, error handling, calculations), characteristics (fast, no external deps, maintainable, easy to debug)
     - **Integration Tests**: When to use (component interaction, DB operations, API endpoints, service-to-service, middleware), characteristics (moderate speed, component boundaries, test DBs/containers)
     - **E2E Tests**: When to use (critical user journeys, cross-system workflows, visual regression, compliance, final validation), characteristics (slower, complete workflows, full environment, realistic but brittle)
     - **Test Level Selection Rules**: Favor unit when (logic isolated, no side effects, fast feedback, high complexity), favor integration when (persistence layer, service contracts, middleware, component boundaries), favor E2E when (user-facing critical paths, multi-system, regulatory, visual regression)
     - **Anti-patterns**: E2E for business logic, unit testing framework behavior, integration testing third-party libraries, duplicate coverage
     - **Duplicate Coverage Guard**: Check if tested at lower level, prefer lower level when possible, overlap only for different aspects or defense in depth

     - **P1 - High (Should Test)**: Core user journeys, frequently used, complex logic, integration points, UX features, primary happy paths and key errors
     - **P2 - Medium (Nice to Test)**: Secondary features, admin functionality, reporting, configuration, UI polish, happy path coverage and basic errors
     - **P3 - Low (Test if Time Permits)**: Rarely used, nice-to-have, cosmetic, non-critical optimizations, smoke tests only
     - **Risk-Based Adjustments**: Increase priority when (high user/financial impact, security/compliance, customer-reported, complex >500 LOC, multiple dependencies), decrease when (feature flag, gradual rollout, strong monitoring, easy rollback, low usage, simple, well-isolated)
     - **Test Coverage by Priority**: P0 (>90% unit, >80% integration, all critical E2E), P1 (>80% unit, >60% integration, main happy E2E), P2 (>60% unit, >40% integration, smoke E2E), P3 (best effort, manual only)
     - **Priority Decision Tree**: Revenue-critical â†’ P0, core journey + high-risk â†’ P0, core journey + low-risk â†’ P1, frequently used â†’ P1, customer-facing â†’ P2, internal â†’ P3

## 5. Workflows

### Workflow 1: Comprehensive Story Review (*review)

**Command**: `*review {story}`
**Task**: `review-story.md`
**Complexity**: Most complex QA workflow
**Output**: Story QA Results section update + Gate YAML file

**Process Flow**:

1. **Load Story and Configuration**
   - Read story file from `{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md`
   - Load `core-config.yaml` for qa.qaLocation
   - Verify prerequisites: Status = "Review", tasks complete, File List updated, tests passing

2. **Risk Assessment (Determines Review Depth)**
   - **Auto-escalate to deep review when**:
     - Auth/payment/security files touched
     - No tests added to story
     - Diff > 500 lines
     - Previous gate was FAIL/CONCERNS
     - Story has > 5 acceptance criteria
   - Else: Standard review depth

3. **Comprehensive Analysis** (6 components):
   - **A. Requirements Traceability**:
     - Map each AC to validating tests
     - Document mapping with Given-When-Then (not test code)
     - Identify coverage gaps
     - Verify all requirements have corresponding test cases
   - **B. Code Quality Review**:
     - Architecture and design patterns
     - Refactoring opportunities (and perform them)
     - Code duplication or inefficiencies
     - Performance optimizations
     - Security vulnerabilities
     - Best practices adherence
   - **C. Test Architecture Assessment**:
     - Test coverage adequacy at appropriate levels
     - Test level appropriateness (unit vs integration vs E2E)
     - Test design quality and maintainability
     - Test data management strategy
     - Mock/stub usage appropriateness
     - Edge case and error scenario coverage
     - Test execution time and reliability

     - Security: Authentication, authorization, data protection
     - Performance: Response times, resource usage
     - Reliability: Error handling, recovery mechanisms
     - Maintainability: Code clarity, documentation
   - **E. Testability Evaluation**:
     - Controllability: Can we control the inputs?
     - Observability: Can we observe the outputs?
     - Debuggability: Can we debug failures easily?
   - **F. Technical Debt Identification**:
     - Accumulated shortcuts
     - Missing tests
     - Outdated dependencies
     - Architecture violations

4. **Active Refactoring**
   - Refactor code where safe and appropriate
   - Run tests to ensure changes don't break functionality
   - Document all changes in QA Results section with clear WHY and HOW
   - Do NOT alter story content beyond QA Results section
   - Do NOT change story Status or File List; recommend next status only

5. **Standards Compliance Check**
   - Verify adherence to `docs/coding-standards.md`
   - Check compliance with `docs/unified-project-structure.md`

   - Ensure all guidelines mentioned in story are followed

6. **Acceptance Criteria Validation**
   - Verify each AC is fully implemented
   - Check for any missing functionality
   - Validate edge cases are handled

7. **Documentation and Comments**
   - Verify code is self-documenting where possible
   - Add comments for complex logic if missing
   - Ensure any API changes are documented

8. **Update Story File - QA Results Section ONLY** (CRITICAL)
   - **QA Results Anchor Rule**: If `## QA Results` doesn't exist, append at end; if exists, append new dated entry
   - **ONLY authorized to update QA Results section**
   - Structure:
     - Review Date, Reviewed By
     - Code Quality Assessment
     - Refactoring Performed (with WHY and HOW for each change)
     - Compliance Check (Coding Standards, Project Structure, Testing Strategy, All ACs Met)
     - Improvements Checklist (checked=handled, unchecked=for dev)
     - Security Review, Performance Considerations
     - Files Modified During Review
     - Gate Status (with links to gate file and assessments)
     - Recommended Status (Ready for Done / Changes Required)

9. **Create Quality Gate File**
   - Render from `qa-gate-tmpl.yaml`
   - Create directory `qa.qaLocation/gates` if missing
   - Save to: `qa.qaLocation/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml`
   - Apply deterministic gate criteria:
     1. Risk thresholds (if risk_summary): score â‰¥9 â†’ FAIL, â‰¥6 â†’ CONCERNS
     2. Test coverage gaps (if trace): P0 test missing â†’ CONCERNS, security/data-loss P0 missing â†’ FAIL
     3. Issue severity: high â†’ FAIL, medium â†’ CONCERNS
     4. NFR statuses: any FAIL â†’ FAIL, any CONCERNS â†’ CONCERNS, else â†’ PASS
   - Calculate quality score: 100 - (20 Ã— FAILs) - (10 Ã— CONCERNS)
   - Set expires: Typically 2 weeks from review

10. **Blocking Conditions** (HALT and request clarification)
    - Story file incomplete or missing critical sections
    - File List empty or clearly incomplete
    - No tests exist when required
    - Code changes don't align with story requirements
    - Critical architectural issues requiring discussion

**Key Features**:
- **Adaptive depth**: Risk signals determine analysis thoroughness
- **Active refactoring**: Direct code improvements during review
- **Comprehensive assessment**: 6 analysis components
- **Deterministic gates**: Clear decision criteria
- **Advisory excellence**: Education through documentation

**Integration Points**:

- **Output**: QA Results in story â†’ Gate file in qa.qaLocation/gates
- **Handoff**: Recommended status for story owner decision
- **Cross-references**: Links to risk profile, NFR assessment, test design (if run)

### Workflow 2: Risk Profiling (*risk-profile)

**Command**: `*risk-profile {story}`
**Task**: `risk-profile.md`
**Complexity**: Medium - Systematic assessment with scoring algorithm
**Output**: Gate YAML block (risk_summary) + Markdown report

**Process Flow**:

1. **Load Story Context**
   - Read story file from `{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md`
   - Extract story_id, story_title, story_slug
   - Understand acceptance criteria and implementation scope

2. **Risk Identification** (Six categories)
   - **TECH**: Architecture complexity, integration challenges, technical debt, scalability, dependencies
   - **SEC**: Auth/authz flaws, data exposure, injection attacks, session management, cryptographic weaknesses
   - **PERF**: Response time degradation, throughput bottlenecks, resource exhaustion, query optimization, caching failures
   - **DATA**: Data loss potential, corruption, privacy violations, compliance issues, backup/recovery gaps
   - **BUS**: Feature doesn't meet user needs, revenue impact, reputation damage, regulatory non-compliance, market timing
   - **OPS**: Deployment failures, monitoring gaps, incident response readiness, documentation inadequacy, knowledge transfer issues
   - For each risk: Assign ID (prefix-number), category, title, description, affected_components, detection_method

3. **Risk Assessment** (Probability Ã— Impact)
   - **Probability Levels**:
     - High (3): Likely to occur (>70% chance)
     - Medium (2): Possible occurrence (30-70% chance)
     - Low (1): Unlikely to occur (<30% chance)
   - **Impact Levels**:
     - High (3): Severe consequences (data breach, system down, major financial loss)
     - Medium (2): Moderate consequences (degraded performance, minor data issues)
     - Low (1): Minor consequences (cosmetic issues, slight inconvenience)
   - **Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact**:
     - 9: Critical Risk (Red) - Immediate attention
     - 6: High Risk (Orange) - High priority
     - 4: Medium Risk (Yellow) - Monitor and plan
     - 2-3: Low Risk (Green) - Accept with awareness
     - 1: Minimal Risk (Blue) - Document only

4. **Risk Prioritization**
   - Create risk matrix sorted by score (descending)
   - Identify highest risk (for gate YAML block)
   - Calculate totals by criticality level (critical/high/medium/low)

5. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
   - For each identified risk, provide mitigation:
     - Strategy type: preventive/detective/corrective
     - Actions: Specific steps to reduce risk
     - Testing requirements: Validation approach
     - Residual risk: What remains after mitigation
     - Owner: dev/sm/po
     - Timeline: When to address
   - Separate must_fix (blocking) from monitor (awareness)

6. **Risk-Based Testing Strategy**
   - **Priority 1**: Critical risk tests (security, load, chaos testing)
   - **Priority 2**: High risk tests (integration, edge cases)
   - **Priority 3**: Medium/low risk tests (standard functional, regression)
   - Map test scenarios to risk mitigations

7. **Generate Gate YAML Block** (for pasting into gate file)
   - **Output rules**:
     - Only include assessed risks (no placeholders)
     - Sort risks by score (descending) in tabular lists
     - If no risks: totals all zeros, omit highest, keep recommendations arrays empty
   ```yaml
   risk_summary:
     totals: { critical: X, high: Y, medium: Z, low: W }
     highest: { id: SEC-001, score: 9, title: 'XSS on profile form' }
     recommendations:
       must_fix: ['Add input sanitization & CSP']
       monitor: ['Add security alerts for auth endpoints']
   ```

8. **Generate Markdown Report**
   - **Save to**: `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-risk-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
   - Structure:
     - Executive Summary (Total Risks, Critical/High counts, Risk Score 0-100)
     - Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention (score 9)
     - Risk Distribution (by category, by component)
     - Detailed Risk Register (full table with scores and mitigations)
     - Risk-Based Testing Strategy (priority 1/2/3 tests)
     - Risk Acceptance Criteria (must fix before production, can deploy with mitigation, accepted risks)
     - Monitoring Requirements (post-deployment monitoring for perf/sec/ops/business risks)
     - Risk Review Triggers (when to update risk profile)

9. **Calculate Overall Story Risk Score**
   ```text
   Base Score = 100
   For each risk:
     - Critical (9): Deduct 20 points
     - High (6): Deduct 10 points
     - Medium (4): Deduct 5 points
     - Low (2-3): Deduct 2 points
   Minimum score = 0 (extremely risky)
   Maximum score = 100 (minimal risk)
   ```

10. **Integration with Quality Gates**
    - **Deterministic gate mapping**:
      - Any risk with score â‰¥ 9 â†’ Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
      - Else if any score â‰¥ 6 â†’ Gate = CONCERNS
      - Else â†’ Gate = PASS
      - Unmitigated risks â†’ Document in gate

11. **Print Story Hook Line** (for review task to quote)
    ```text
    Risk profile: qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-risk-{YYYYMMDD}.md
    ```

**Key Features**:
- **Systematic framework**: Six risk categories with consistent scoring
- **Deterministic scoring**: Probability Ã— Impact = Score (1-9)
- **Actionable mitigations**: Preventive/detective/corrective strategies
- **Risk-based test focus**: Align testing priorities with risks
- **Gate integration**: Scores directly influence gate decisions

**Integration Points**:
- **Input**: Story with implementation details
- **Output**: Gate YAML block â†’ Risk assessment markdown
- **Used by**: `*review` workflow (incorporates risk_summary into gate)
- **Cross-references**: Linked from story QA Results section

### Workflow 3: Test Design (*test-design)

**Command**: `*test-design {story}`
**Task**: `test-design.md`
**Dependencies**: `test-levels-framework.md`, `test-priorities-matrix.md`
**Complexity**: Medium - Systematic scenario generation with level/priority assignment
**Output**: Test Design Document + Gate YAML block

**Process Flow**:

1. **Load Story and Frameworks**
   - Read story file from `{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md`
   - Load `test-levels-framework.md` for unit/integration/E2E decision criteria
   - Load `test-priorities-matrix.md` for P0/P1/P2/P3 classification
   - Extract acceptance criteria and implementation details

2. **Analyze Story Requirements**
   - For each acceptance criterion:
     - Identify core functionality to test
     - Determine data variations needed
     - Consider error conditions
     - Note edge cases
   - Break down into testable scenarios

3. **Apply Test Level Framework**
   - **Unit Tests**: Pure logic, algorithms, calculations, validation, error handling
     - Fast execution, no external dependencies, highly maintainable, easy to debug
     - Choose when: Logic can be isolated, no side effects, fast feedback needed, high cyclomatic complexity
   - **Integration Tests**: Component interactions, DB operations, API endpoints, service-to-service, middleware
     - Moderate execution time, tests component boundaries, may use test DBs/containers
     - Choose when: Persistence layer, service contracts, middleware/interceptors, component boundaries critical
   - **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys, cross-system workflows, visual regression, compliance
     - Slower execution, complete workflows, requires full environment, realistic but brittle
     - Choose when: User-facing critical paths, multi-system interactions, regulatory compliance, visual regression
   - **Duplicate Coverage Guard**: Before adding test, check if already tested at lower level

4. **Assign Priorities** (P0/P1/P2/P3)
   - **P0 - Critical (Must Test)**:
     - Revenue-impacting, security-critical, data integrity, regulatory compliance, previously broken
     - Comprehensive coverage at all levels, both happy and unhappy paths, edge cases and errors, performance under load
   - **P1 - High (Should Test)**:
     - Core user journeys, frequently used, complex logic, integration points, UX features
     - Primary happy paths, key error scenarios, critical edge cases, basic performance validation
   - **P2 - Medium (Nice to Test)**:
     - Secondary features, admin functionality, reporting, configuration, UI polish
     - Happy path coverage, basic error handling, can defer edge cases
   - **P3 - Low (Test if Time Permits)**:
     - Rarely used, nice-to-have, cosmetic, non-critical optimizations
     - Smoke tests only, can rely on manual testing, document known limitations
   - **Risk-Based Adjustments**:
     - Increase priority: High user/financial impact, security/compliance, customer-reported, complex >500 LOC, multiple dependencies
     - Decrease priority: Feature flag, gradual rollout, strong monitoring, easy rollback, low usage, simple, well-isolated

5. **Design Test Scenarios**
   - For each identified test need, create:
     ```yaml
     test_scenario:
       id: '{epic}.{story}-{LEVEL}-{SEQ}' # e.g., 1.3-UNIT-001
       requirement: 'AC reference'
       priority: P0|P1|P2|P3
       level: unit|integration|e2e
       description: 'What is being tested'
       justification: 'Why this level was chosen'
       mitigates_risks: ['RISK-001'] # If risk profile exists
     ```

6. **Validate Coverage**
   - Ensure:
     - Every AC has at least one test
     - No duplicate coverage across levels
     - Critical paths have multiple levels (defense in depth)
     - Risk mitigations are addressed
   - Identify coverage gaps

7. **Generate Test Design Document**
   - **Save to**: `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-test-design-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
   - Structure:
     - Test Strategy Overview (total scenarios, unit/integration/E2E counts, priority distribution)
     - Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria (table with ID, Level, Priority, Test, Justification)
     - Risk Coverage (map test scenarios to identified risks if risk profile exists)
     - Recommended Execution Order (P0 unit â†’ P0 integration â†’ P0 E2E â†’ P1 â†’ P2+)

8. **Generate Gate YAML Block**
   ```yaml
   test_design:
     scenarios_total: X
     by_level: { unit: Y, integration: Z, e2e: W }
     by_priority: { p0: A, p1: B, p2: C }
     coverage_gaps: [] # List any ACs without tests
   ```

9. **Print Trace References** (for use by trace-requirements task)
   ```text
   Test design matrix: qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-test-design-{YYYYMMDD}.md
   P0 tests identified: {count}
   ```

10. **Quality Checklist Validation**
    - [ ] Every AC has test coverage
    - [ ] Test levels are appropriate (not over-testing)
    - [ ] No duplicate coverage across levels
    - [ ] Priorities align with business risk
    - [ ] Test IDs follow naming convention
    - [ ] Scenarios are atomic and independent

**Key Principles**:
- **Shift left**: Prefer unit over integration, integration over E2E
- **Risk-based**: Focus on what could go wrong
- **Efficient coverage**: Test once at the right level
- **Maintainability**: Consider long-term test maintenance
- **Fast feedback**: Quick tests run first

**Integration Points**:
- **Input**: Story with acceptance criteria
- **Output**: Test Design Document â†’ Gate YAML block
- **Used by**: `*trace` workflow (references test design for traceability)
- **Cross-references**: Linked from story QA Results section, risk profile

### Workflow 4: Requirements Traceability (*trace)

**Command**: `*trace {story}`
**Task**: `trace-requirements.md`
**Complexity**: Medium - Systematic requirement-to-test mapping
**Output**: Gate YAML block (trace) + Traceability Report

**Process Flow**:

1. **Load Story and Test Design**
   - Read story file from `{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md`
   - Load test design document (if exists): `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-test-design-{date}.md`
   - Extract acceptance criteria, tasks/subtasks, NFRs, edge cases

2. **Extract Requirements** (From 5 sources)
   - Acceptance Criteria (primary source)
   - User story statement
   - Tasks/subtasks with specific behaviors
   - Non-functional requirements mentioned
   - Edge cases documented

3. **Map to Test Cases** (Using Given-When-Then)
   - **IMPORTANT**: GWT is for documenting the mapping, NOT for writing test code
   - For each requirement, document which tests validate it:
     ```yaml
     requirement: 'AC1: User can login with valid credentials'
     test_mappings:
       - test_file: 'auth/login.test.ts'
         test_case: 'should successfully login with valid email and password'
         # GWT describes WHAT the test validates
         given: 'A registered user with valid credentials'
         when: 'They submit the login form'
         then: 'They are redirected to dashboard and session is created'
         coverage: full
     ```
   - **Given**: Initial context (state/data, user context, system preconditions)
   - **When**: Action performed (execution, API calls, events)
   - **Then**: Assertions (expected outcomes, state changes, values)

4. **Coverage Analysis** (5 levels)
   - **full**: Requirement completely tested
   - **partial**: Some aspects tested, gaps exist
   - **none**: No test coverage found
   - **integration**: Covered in integration/e2e tests only
   - **unit**: Covered in unit tests only
   - Evaluate coverage for each requirement

5. **Gap Identification**
   - For each gap found:
     ```yaml
     coverage_gaps:
       - requirement: 'AC3: Password reset email sent within 60 seconds'
         gap: 'No test for email delivery timing'
         severity: medium
         suggested_test:
           type: integration
           description: 'Test email service SLA compliance'
     ```
   - Prioritize gaps by severity (high/medium/low)

6. **Generate Gate YAML Block** (for pasting into gate file)
   ```yaml
   trace:
     totals: { requirements: X, full: Y, partial: Z, none: W }
     planning_ref: 'qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-test-design-{date}.md'
     uncovered:
       - ac: 'AC3'
         reason: 'No test found for password reset timing'
     notes: 'See qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-{date}.md'
   ```

7. **Generate Traceability Report**
   - **Save to**: `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
   - Structure:
     - **Coverage Summary**: Total Requirements, Fully Covered (%), Partially Covered (%), Not Covered (%)
     - **Requirement Mappings**: For each AC, list coverage level and Given-When-Then mappings
       - **Unit Test**: test_file::test_case with GWT
       - **Integration Test**: test_file::test_case with GWT
       - **E2E Test**: test_file::test_case with GWT
     - **Critical Gaps**: Priority-sorted gaps with risk and action
       - Performance Requirements (no load testing â†’ high risk â†’ implement load tests)
       - Security Requirements (rate limiting not tested â†’ medium risk â†’ add rate limit tests)
     - **Test Design Recommendations**: Additional scenarios needed, test types to implement, test data requirements, mock/stub strategies
     - **Risk Assessment**: High risk (no coverage), medium risk (partial coverage), low risk (full unit + integration coverage)

8. **Traceability Best Practices**
   - **Given-When-Then for Mapping** (Not Test Code): Document what each test validates
   - **Coverage Priority**: Critical business flows, security, data integrity, user-facing features, performance SLAs
   - **Test Granularity**: Unit for business logic, integration for component interaction, E2E for user journeys, performance for NFRs

9. **Quality Indicators**
   - Good traceability shows:
     - Every AC has at least one test
     - Critical paths have multiple test levels
     - Edge cases are explicitly covered
     - NFRs have appropriate test types
     - Clear Given-When-Then for each test

10. **Red Flags**
    - ACs with no test coverage
    - Tests that don't map to requirements
    - Vague test descriptions
    - Missing edge case coverage
    - NFRs without specific tests

11. **Integration with Gates**
    - Critical gaps â†’ FAIL
    - Minor gaps â†’ CONCERNS
    - Missing P0 tests from test-design â†’ CONCERNS
    - Full coverage â†’ PASS contribution

12. **Print Story Hook Line** (for review task to quote)
    ```text
    Trace matrix: qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md
    ```

**Key Principles**:
- **Every requirement must be testable**
- **Use Given-When-Then for clarity** (documentation, not code)
- **Identify both presence and absence** (gaps as important as coverage)
- **Prioritize based on risk**
- **Make recommendations actionable**

**Integration Points**:
- **Input**: Story + Test Design Document (if exists)
- **Output**: Gate YAML block â†’ Traceability Report
- **Used by**: `*review` workflow (incorporates trace into gate)
- **Cross-references**: Linked from story QA Results section, references test design

### Workflow 5: NFR Assessment (*nfr-assess)

**Command**: `*nfr-assess {story}`
**Task**: `nfr-assess.md`
**Complexity**: Low-Medium - Quick validation focused on core four NFRs
**Output**: Gate YAML block (nfr_validation) + Brief Assessment Report

**Process Flow**:

1. **Load Story and Configuration**
   - Read story file from `devStoryLocation` (from `core-config.yaml`)
   - Load optional: architecture refs, technical-preferences
   - Extract acceptance criteria and NFR requirements
   - **Fail-safe**: If story not found, still create assessment with "Source story not found" note

2. **Elicit Scope** (Interactive vs Non-interactive)
   - **Interactive mode**: Ask which NFRs to assess
     ```text
     Which NFRs should I assess? (Enter numbers or press Enter for default)
     [1] Security (default)
     [2] Performance (default)
     [3] Reliability (default)
     [4] Maintainability (default)
     [5] Usability
     [6] Compatibility
     [7] Portability
     [8] Functional Suitability
     > [Enter for 1-4]
     ```
   - **Non-interactive mode**: Default to core four (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)

3. **Check for Thresholds**
   - Look for NFR requirements in:
     - Story acceptance criteria
     - `docs/architecture/*.md` files
     - `docs/technical-preferences.md`
   - **Interactive mode**: Ask for missing thresholds
     ```text
     No performance requirements found. What's your target response time?
     > 200ms for API calls
     ```
   - **Non-interactive mode**: Mark as CONCERNS with "Target unknown"
   - **Unknown targets policy**: If target missing and not provided, mark as CONCERNS with "Target unknown"

4. **Quick Assessment** (For each selected NFR)
   - Check:
     - Is there evidence it's implemented?
     - Can we validate it?
     - Are there obvious gaps?
   - Apply assessment criteria:
     - **Security**:
       - PASS: Auth implemented, authorization enforced, input validation, no hardcoded secrets
       - CONCERNS: Missing rate limiting, weak encryption, incomplete authorization
       - FAIL: No authentication, hardcoded credentials, SQL injection vulnerabilities
     - **Performance**:
       - PASS: Meets response time targets, no obvious bottlenecks, reasonable resource usage
       - CONCERNS: Close to limits, missing indexes, no caching strategy
       - FAIL: Exceeds response time limits, memory leaks, unoptimized queries
     - **Reliability**:
       - PASS: Error handling present, graceful degradation, retry logic where needed
       - CONCERNS: Some error cases unhandled, no circuit breakers, missing health checks
       - FAIL: No error handling, crashes on errors, no recovery mechanisms
     - **Maintainability**:
       - PASS: Test coverage meets target, code well-structured, documentation present
       - CONCERNS: Test coverage below target, some code duplication, missing documentation
       - FAIL: No tests, highly coupled code, no documentation

5. **Generate Gate YAML Block** (ONLY for NFRs actually assessed - no placeholders)
   ```yaml
   nfr_validation:
     _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
     security: { status: CONCERNS, notes: 'No rate limiting on auth endpoints' }
     performance: { status: PASS, notes: 'Response times < 200ms verified' }
     reliability: { status: PASS, notes: 'Error handling and retries implemented' }
     maintainability: { status: CONCERNS, notes: 'Test coverage at 65%, target is 80%' }
   ```

6. **Apply Deterministic Status Rules**
   - **FAIL**: Any selected NFR has critical gap or target clearly not met
   - **CONCERNS**: No FAILs, but any NFR is unknown/partial/missing evidence
   - **PASS**: All selected NFRs meet targets with evidence

7. **Calculate Quality Score**
   ```text
   quality_score = 100
   - 20 for each FAIL attribute
   - 10 for each CONCERNS attribute
   Floor at 0, ceiling at 100
   ```
   - If `technical-preferences.md` defines custom weights, use those instead

8. **Generate Brief Assessment Report**
   - **ALWAYS save to**: `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-nfr-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
   - Structure:
     ```markdown
     # NFR Assessment: {epic}.{story}

     Date: {date}
     Reviewer: Quinn

     <!-- Note: Source story not found (if applicable) -->

     ## Summary
     - Security: CONCERNS - Missing rate limiting
     - Performance: PASS - Meets <200ms requirement
     - Reliability: PASS - Proper error handling
     - Maintainability: CONCERNS - Test coverage below target

     ## Critical Issues
     1. **No rate limiting** (Security)
        - Risk: Brute force attacks possible
        - Fix: Add rate limiting middleware to auth endpoints

     2. **Test coverage 65%** (Maintainability)
        - Risk: Untested code paths
        - Fix: Add tests for uncovered branches

     ## Quick Wins
     - Add rate limiting: ~2 hours
     - Increase test coverage: ~4 hours
     - Add performance monitoring: ~1 hour
     ```

9. **Print Story Update Line** (for review task to quote)
   ```text
   NFR assessment: qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-nfr-{YYYYMMDD}.md
   ```

10. **Print Gate Integration Line**
    ```text
    Gate NFR block ready â†’ paste into qa.qaLocation/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml under nfr_validation
    ```

**Key Principles**:
- **Focus on core four NFRs by default** (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
- **Quick assessment, not deep analysis** (use specialized tasks for depth)
- **Gate-ready output format** (YAML block for direct pasting)
- **Brief, actionable findings**
- **Skip what doesn't apply**
- **Deterministic status rules for consistency**
- **Unknown targets â†’ CONCERNS, not guesses**

**Integration Points**:
- **Input**: Story with implementation + optional architecture/preferences
- **Output**: Gate YAML block â†’ Brief Assessment Report
- **Used by**: `*review` workflow (incorporates nfr_validation into gate)
- **Cross-references**: Linked from story QA Results section

### Workflow 6: Quality Gate Decision (*gate)

**Command**: `*gate {story}`
**Task**: `qa-gate.md`
**Complexity**: Low - Generate standalone gate file based on review findings
**Output**: Gate YAML file + Story QA Results update

**Process Flow**:

1. **Load Story and Configuration**
   - Read story file from `{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md`
   - Load `core-config.yaml` for `qa.qaLocation/gates`
   - Extract story_id, story_title, story_slug
   - **Slug rules**: Lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens, strip punctuation
     - Example: "User Auth - Login!" â†’ "user-auth-login"

2. **Gather Review Findings**
   - Review has been completed (manually or via review-story task)
   - Review findings are available
   - Understanding of story requirements and implementation

3. **Determine Gate Decision** (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED)
   - **PASS**: All acceptance criteria met, no high-severity issues, test coverage meets standards
   - **CONCERNS**: Non-blocking issues present, should be tracked and scheduled, can proceed with awareness
   - **FAIL**: Acceptance criteria not met, high-severity issues present, recommend return to InProgress
   - **WAIVED**: Issues explicitly accepted, requires approval and reason, proceed despite known issues

4. **Collect Top Issues** (If any)
   - For each issue:
     ```yaml
     - id: 'SEC-001' # Use prefix: SEC-, PERF-, REL-, TEST-, MNT-, ARCH-, DOC-, REQ-
       severity: high # ONLY: low|medium|high
       finding: 'No rate limiting on login endpoint'
       suggested_action: 'Add rate limiting middleware before production'
     ```
   - **Severity Scale** (FIXED VALUES - NO VARIATIONS):
     - `low`: Minor issues, cosmetic problems
     - `medium`: Should fix soon, not blocking
     - `high`: Critical issues, should block release

5. **Generate Gate File** (Minimal required schema)
   - **ALWAYS** create at: `qa.qaLocation/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml`
   - Schema:
     ```yaml
     schema: 1
     story: '{epic}.{story}'
     gate: PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL|WAIVED
     status_reason: '1-2 sentence explanation of gate decision'
     reviewer: 'Quinn'
     updated: '{ISO-8601 timestamp}'
     top_issues: [] # Empty array if no issues
     waiver: { active: false } # Only set active: true if WAIVED
     ```
   - **If issues exist**:
     ```yaml
     top_issues:
       - id: 'SEC-001'
         severity: high
         finding: 'No rate limiting on login endpoint'
         suggested_action: 'Add rate limiting middleware before production'
     ```
   - **If waived**:
     ```yaml
     waiver:
       active: true
       reason: 'Known issues accepted for MVP release.'
       approved_by: 'Product Owner'
     ```

6. **Update Story File - QA Results Section**
   - **ALWAYS** append this exact format to story's QA Results section:
     ```markdown
     ## QA Results

     ### Review Date: {date}

     ### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

     [... existing review content ...]

     ### Gate Status

     Gate: {STATUS} â†’ qa.qaLocation/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml
     ```

7. **Output Requirements Checklist**
   - [ ] Gate file created at correct path
   - [ ] Story QA Results section updated with gate reference
   - [ ] status_reason is 1-2 sentences maximum
   - [ ] Severity values are exactly: `low`, `medium`, or `high`

**Key Principles**:
- **Keep it minimal and predictable**
- **Fixed severity scale** (low/medium/high)
- **Always write to standard path**
- **Always update story with gate reference**
- **Clear, actionable findings**

**Integration Points**:
- **Input**: Story with review findings (from manual review or *review command)
- **Output**: Gate YAML file â†’ Story QA Results update
- **Used by**: `*review` workflow (creates gate as final step)
- **Standalone**: Can also be run independently to create/update gate

---

## 7. Integration Points

### Handoffs TO QA Agent

**From Dev Agent**:
- **Trigger**: Dev sets story Status to "Review"
- **Input**: Story file with completed tasks, File List, passing tests
- **Prerequisites**: All tasks marked [x], validations passing, DoD checklist complete
- **Entry Point**: `*review {story}` command

**From SM/PO (Optional)**:
- **Trigger**: Request for test design or risk assessment during planning
- **Input**: Story draft with acceptance criteria
- **Entry Point**: `*test-design {story}`, `*risk-profile {story}`, `*nfr-assess {story}`

### Handoffs FROM QA Agent

**To Dev Agent**:
- **Trigger**: Gate decision CONCERNS or FAIL
- **Output**: Story QA Results section with Improvements Checklist, gate file
- **Next Action**: Dev reviews unchecked items, applies fixes via `*review-qa` command
- **Entry Point**: Dev command `*review-qa` references QA gate and assessments

**To Story Owner (SM/PO)**:
- **Trigger**: Gate decision PASS or WAIVED
- **Output**: Recommended status in QA Results section ("Ready for Done" or "Changes Required")
- **Next Action**: Story owner decides final status (story owner makes call, not QA)

### Shared Artifacts

**Story File** (`{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md`):
- **QA Writes**: QA Results section (exclusive)
- **QA Reads**: All sections (Status, Story, ACs, Tasks, Dev Notes, Testing, Dev Agent Record, File List)
- **Other Agents**: SM creates, Dev updates Dev Agent Record and File List, PO validates

**Gate Files** (`qa.qaLocation/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml`):
- **QA Writes**: Creates and updates gate files
- **Dev Reads**: Processes gate findings via `apply-qa-fixes.md` task
- **PO Reads**: Understands quality status for story approval decisions

**Assessment Reports** (`qa.qaLocation/assessments/`):
- **QA Writes**: Creates risk, NFR, test design, trace reports
- **Dev Reads**: References during fix application
- **SM/PO Read**: Understands story quality and testing strategy

### Workflow Dependencies

**Sequential Dependencies**:
1. **Story Creation** (SM) â†’ **Story Validation** (PO optional) â†’ **Story Implementation** (Dev) â†’ **Story Review** (QA)
2. Within QA review: **Risk Profile** â†’ **Test Design** â†’ **Trace Requirements** â†’ **NFR Assessment** â†’ **Gate Decision**

**Parallel Capabilities**:
- QA can run `*risk-profile`, `*test-design`, `*nfr-assess`, `*trace` independently or as part of comprehensive `*review`
- Each task produces standalone outputs (assessments) that can be referenced by gate file

**Feedback Loops**:
- **QA â†’ Dev â†’ QA**: Gate CONCERNS/FAIL â†’ Dev fixes via `*review-qa` â†’ QA re-reviews â†’ New gate decision
- **QA â†’ SM/PO â†’ Dev â†’ QA**: Gate identifies requirements gap â†’ SM/PO updates story â†’ Dev implements â†’ QA re-reviews

## 8. Special Features

### 1. Adaptive Review Depth (Risk-Based Escalation)

**Auto-escalate to deep review when**:
- Auth/payment/security files touched
- No tests added to story
- Diff > 500 lines
- Previous gate was FAIL or CONCERNS
- Story has > 5 acceptance criteria

**Standard review** (concise) otherwise

**Benefit**: Efficient thoroughness - comprehensive where it matters, lightweight for low-risk changes

### 2. Active Refactoring Authority

**Unique to QA agent**: Can directly improve code during review

**Refactoring Scope**:
- Refactor code where safe and appropriate
- Run tests to ensure changes don't break functionality
- Document all changes in QA Results section with clear WHY and HOW
- Do NOT alter story content beyond QA Results section
- Do NOT change story Status or File List; recommend next status only

**Documentation Requirements**:
```markdown
### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: services/user.service.ts
  - **Change**: Extracted validation logic to UserValidator class
  - **Why**: Reduce service complexity and improve testability
  - **How**: Created UserValidator.validate() method, injected into service
```

**Benefit**: Direct quality improvements during review, not just recommendations

### 3. Deterministic Gate Criteria (Consistent Decision-Making)

**Applied in order**:

1. **Risk thresholds** (if risk_summary present):
   - Any risk score â‰¥ 9 â†’ Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
   - Else if any score â‰¥ 6 â†’ Gate = CONCERNS

2. **Test coverage gaps** (if trace available):
   - If any P0 test from test-design missing â†’ Gate = CONCERNS
   - If security/data-loss P0 test missing â†’ Gate = FAIL

3. **Issue severity**:
   - If any `top_issues.severity == high` â†’ Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
   - Else if any `severity == medium` â†’ Gate = CONCERNS

4. **NFR statuses**:
   - If any NFR status is FAIL â†’ Gate = FAIL
   - Else if any NFR status is CONCERNS â†’ Gate = CONCERNS
   - Else â†’ Gate = PASS

**Waiver Override**: WAIVED only when `waiver.active: true` with reason/approver

**Benefit**: Consistent, predictable, transparent gate decisions

### 4. Quality Score Calculation (Quantitative Assessment)

**Formula**:
```text
quality_score = 100 - (20 Ã— number of FAILs) - (10 Ã— number of CONCERNS)
Bounded between 0 and 100
```

**Custom Weights**: If `technical-preferences.md` defines custom weights, use those instead

**Application**:
- NFR assessment: Score based on NFR statuses
- Gate file: Overall quality score in extended fields

**Benefit**: Quantitative quality metric for tracking and comparison

### 5. Advisory (Not Blocking) Philosophy

**Core Principle**: "Teams choose their quality bar"

**Implementation**:
- Gate decisions are **recommendations**, not mandates
- Story owner decides final status (QA only recommends)
- WAIVED status available for explicitly accepted issues
- Educate through documentation, never block arbitrarily

**Gate Rationale**:
- **PASS**: "Go ahead with confidence"
- **CONCERNS**: "Proceed with awareness of these issues"
- **FAIL**: "We recommend addressing these before proceeding"
- **WAIVED**: "Issues acknowledged and accepted by team"

**Benefit**: Empowers teams while providing expert guidance

### 6. Comprehensive Assessment Framework (Multi-Dimensional Quality)

**Six Quality Dimensions**:
1. **Requirements Traceability**: Every AC maps to tests
2. **Code Quality**: Architecture, refactoring, duplication, performance, security
3. **Test Architecture**: Coverage, test levels, design quality, maintainability
4. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Security, performance, reliability, maintainability
5. **Testability**: Controllability, observability, debuggability
6. **Technical Debt**: Shortcuts, missing tests, outdated deps, violations

**Benefit**: Holistic quality assessment, not just test coverage

### 7. Systematic Risk Assessment (Probability Ã— Impact)

**Risk Framework**:
- **Six categories**: TECH, SEC, PERF, DATA, BUS, OPS
- **Scoring algorithm**: Probability (1-3) Ã— Impact (1-3) = Score (1-9)
- **Criticality levels**: 9=Critical, 6=High, 4=Medium, 2-3=Low, 1=Minimal
- **Mitigation strategies**: Preventive/detective/corrective actions

**Integration with Testing**:
- Risk-based test priorities (P0/P1/P2/P3 align with risk scores)
- Test scenarios explicitly mitigate identified risks

**Benefit**: Prioritize quality efforts based on actual risk

### 8. Test Level Framework (Shift Left Testing)

**Decision Criteria**:
- **Unit**: Pure logic, algorithms, calculations (fast, no external deps)
- **Integration**: Component interactions, DB, APIs (moderate speed, component boundaries)
- **E2E**: Critical user journeys, compliance (slower, complete workflows)

**Duplicate Coverage Guard**:
- Before adding test, check if already tested at lower level
- Prefer unit over integration, integration over E2E
- Overlap only for different aspects or defense in depth

**Benefit**: Efficient coverage - test once at the right level

### 9. Requirements Traceability with Given-When-Then

**Key Feature**: GWT for documentation, NOT for test code

**Purpose**: Map requirements to tests for clarity and gap identification

**Given-When-Then Structure**:
- **Given**: Initial context (state/data, user context, preconditions)
- **When**: Action performed (execution, API calls, events)
- **Then**: Expected outcome (assertions, state changes, values)

**Coverage Levels**: full, partial, none, integration (only), unit (only)

**Benefit**: Clear requirement-to-test mapping without imposing BDD syntax in test code

### 10. NFR Assessment with Unknown Targets Policy

**Core Four NFRs by default**: Security, performance, reliability, maintainability

**Unknown Targets Handling**:
- **Interactive mode**: Ask user for missing thresholds
- **Non-interactive mode**: Mark as CONCERNS with "Target unknown"
- **No guessing**: Never invent thresholds

**Fail-safe**: If story not found, still create assessment with "Source story not found" note

**Benefit**: Honest assessment even when requirements incomplete

### 11. Gate File as Standalone Artifact

**Design**: Quality gate is a **first-class artifact**, not buried in story file

**Structure**:
- YAML format for machine-readability
- Minimal required schema (schema, story, gate, status_reason, reviewer, updated, top_issues, waiver)
- Optional extended fields (quality_score, expires, evidence, nfr_validation, risk_summary, recommendations, history)

**Benefits**:
- Independent tracking of quality decisions
- Audit trail (history field)
- Machine-parseable for dashboards/reporting
- Version-controlled quality gates

### 12. LLM-Accelerated Systematic Analysis

**Principle**: "Use LLMs to accelerate thorough yet focused analysis"

**Systematic Frameworks**:
- Test levels framework (unit/integration/E2E decision criteria)
- Priorities matrix (P0/P1/P2/P3 classification)
- Risk assessment (six categories, probability Ã— impact)
- NFR assessment (core four with deterministic status rules)
- Given-When-Then traceability

**Benefit**: LLM can execute sophisticated quality analysis consistently using these frameworks

---

## 9. Story File Permissions (CRITICAL)

### QA Agent Permissions

**ONLY Authorized to Update**: `## QA Results` section

**Explicitly FORBIDDEN to Modify**:
- Status (except via recommendation in QA Results)
- Story
- Acceptance Criteria
- Tasks / Subtasks
- Dev Notes
- Testing
- Dev Agent Record
- Change Log
- File List
- Any other sections

### QA Results Section Anchor Rule

**If section doesn't exist**:
- Append `## QA Results` at end of file

**If section exists**:
- Append new dated entry below existing entries
- Never edit existing QA Results entries

### QA Results Section Structure

```markdown
## QA Results

### Review Date: [Date]

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
[Overall assessment]

### Refactoring Performed
[List changes with WHY and HOW]
- **File**: [filename]
  - **Change**: [what was changed]
  - **Why**: [reason]
  - **How**: [how it improves]

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: [âœ“/âœ—] [notes]
- Project Structure: [âœ“/âœ—] [notes]
- Testing Strategy: [âœ“/âœ—] [notes]
- All ACs Met: [âœ“/âœ—] [notes]

### Improvements Checklist
[Checked=handled, unchecked=for dev]
- [x] Handled by QA
- [ ] For dev to address

### Security Review
[Findings and whether addressed]

### Performance Considerations
[Findings and whether addressed]

### Files Modified During Review
[If QA modified code, list files - ask Dev to update File List]

### Gate Status
Gate: {STATUS} â†’ qa.qaLocation/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml
Risk profile: qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-risk-{YYYYMMDD}.md
NFR assessment: qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-nfr-{YYYYMMDD}.md

### Recommended Status
[âœ“ Ready for Done] / [âœ— Changes Required - See unchecked items above]
(Story owner decides final status)
```

### Permission Enforcement

**Critical Constraint**: `story-file-permissions` in agent definition:
```yaml
story-file-permissions:
  - CRITICAL: When reviewing stories, you are ONLY authorized to update the "QA Results" section
  - CRITICAL: DO NOT modify any other sections
  - CRITICAL: Your updates must be limited to appending your review results in the QA Results section only
```

**Rationale**:
- **QA is advisory**, not directive (doesn't set story status)
- **Story owner decides** final status (QA only recommends)
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Dev owns implementation sections, QA owns review sections
- **Prevents accidental overwrites** of dev work

---

## 10. Configuration Dependencies

### Core Configuration File

**Location**: `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`

**QA-Specific Settings**:
```yaml
qa:
  qaLocation: 'docs/qa' # Base directory for all QA outputs

# Other settings QA reads:
devStoryLocation: 'docs/stories' # Where to find story files
architecture:
  architectureFile: 'docs/architecture/architecture.md' # For NFR assessment
technicalPreferences: 'docs/technical-preferences.md' # For custom quality score weights
```

**Usage**:
- **ALWAYS** load `core-config.yaml` during activation (per activation-instructions)
- **ALWAYS** reference `qa.qaLocation` for gate and assessment file paths
- **ALWAYS** reference `devStoryLocation` for story file paths

### Path Resolution Rules

**Gate Files**:
```text
{qa.qaLocation}/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml

Example:
qa.qaLocation = 'docs/qa'
story = '1.3'
slug = 'user-auth-login'
â†’ docs/qa/gates/1.3-user-auth-login.yml
```

**Assessment Reports**:
```text
{qa.qaLocation}/assessments/{epic}.{story}-{type}-{YYYYMMDD}.md

Examples:
docs/qa/assessments/1.3-risk-20251014.md
docs/qa/assessments/1.3-nfr-20251014.md
docs/qa/assessments/1.3-test-design-20251014.md
docs/qa/assessments/1.3-trace-20251014.md
```

**Story Files**:
```text
{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md

Example:
devStoryLocation = 'docs/stories'
story = '1.3'
â†’ docs/stories/1.3.user-auth-login.md
```

### Slug Generation Rules

**Slug Format**: Lowercase, hyphenated, punctuation stripped

**Algorithm**:
1. Convert to lowercase
2. Replace spaces with hyphens
3. Strip punctuation

**Examples**:
- "User Auth - Login!" â†’ "user-auth-login"
- "Create Payment Form" â†’ "create-payment-form"
- "Fix Bug #123" â†’ "fix-bug-123"

---

## 11. Critical Insights

### 1. QA Agent is Advisory, Not Blocking

**Philosophy**: "Teams choose their quality bar"

**Implementation**:
- Gate decisions are recommendations, not mandates
- Story owner decides final status (QA only recommends in QA Results section)
- WAIVED status available for explicitly accepted issues
- Educate through documentation, never block arbitrarily

**Contrast with PO Agent**: PO validates planning artifacts with GO/NO-GO decisions; QA provides advisory quality gates for implementation artifacts

### 2. Active Refactoring Authority (Unique Capability)

**QA is the ONLY agent authorized to refactor code during review**

**Scope**:
- Direct code improvements where safe and appropriate
- Run tests to ensure changes don't break functionality
- Document all changes in QA Results with WHY and HOW
- Ask Dev to update File List if files modified

**Benefit**: Not just "recommend improvements" but "make improvements and explain them"

### 3. Adaptive Review Depth (Risk-Based Escalation)

**Auto-escalate to deep review** for high-risk signals:
- Auth/payment/security files touched
- No tests added
- Diff > 500 lines
- Previous gate FAIL/CONCERNS
- Story has > 5 acceptance criteria

**Standard review** otherwise

**Benefit**: Efficient thoroughness - deep where it matters, concise for low-risk

### 4. Comprehensive Assessment Framework (6 Quality Dimensions)

**Most comprehensive quality analysis in BMad framework**:
1. Requirements Traceability (every AC â†’ tests)
2. Code Quality (architecture, refactoring, duplication, performance, security)
3. Test Architecture (coverage, levels, design, maintainability)
4. Non-Functional Requirements (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
5. Testability (controllability, observability, debuggability)
6. Technical Debt (shortcuts, missing tests, outdated deps, violations)

**Contrast**: Dev focuses on implementation; QA provides holistic quality lens

### 5. Deterministic Gate Criteria (Transparent Decisions)

**Applied in order**:
1. Risk thresholds (score â‰¥9 â†’ FAIL, â‰¥6 â†’ CONCERNS)
2. Test coverage gaps (P0 missing â†’ CONCERNS, security/data P0 missing â†’ FAIL)
3. Issue severity (high â†’ FAIL, medium â†’ CONCERNS)
4. NFR statuses (any FAIL â†’ FAIL, any CONCERNS â†’ CONCERNS, else â†’ PASS)

**Benefit**: Consistent, predictable, auditable gate decisions

### 6. Gate File as First-Class Artifact

**Design**: Quality gate is standalone YAML file, not buried in story

**Benefits**:
- Independent tracking of quality decisions
- Audit trail (history field)
- Machine-parseable for dashboards/reporting
- Version-controlled quality gates
- Cross-referenced from story QA Results section

### 7. Systematic Risk Assessment (Probability Ã— Impact)

**Framework**:
- Six categories (TECH, SEC, PERF, DATA, BUS, OPS)
- Scoring: Probability (1-3) Ã— Impact (1-3) = Score (1-9)
- Criticality: 9=Critical, 6=High, 4=Medium, 2-3=Low, 1=Minimal
- Mitigations: Preventive/detective/corrective actions

**Integration**: Risk scores directly influence gate decisions and test priorities

### 8. Test Level Framework with Duplicate Coverage Guard

**Shift Left Philosophy**: Prefer unit over integration, integration over E2E

**Decision Criteria**:
- Unit: Pure logic, fast, no external deps
- Integration: Component interactions, moderate speed
- E2E: Critical user journeys, slower, complete workflows

**Duplicate Coverage Guard**: Before adding test, check if already tested at lower level

**Benefit**: Efficient coverage - test once at the right level

### 9. Requirements Traceability with GWT (Not Test Code)

**Key Distinction**: Given-When-Then is for DOCUMENTATION, NOT for writing test code

**Purpose**: Map requirements to tests for clarity and gap identification

**Format**:
- Given: Initial context
- When: Action performed
- Then: Expected outcome

**Benefit**: Clear traceability without imposing BDD syntax in actual test code

### 10. NFR Assessment with Unknown Targets Policy

**Core Four NFRs by default**: Security, performance, reliability, maintainability

**Unknown Targets Handling**:
- Interactive: Ask user for thresholds
- Non-interactive: Mark as CONCERNS with "Target unknown"
- Never guess or invent thresholds

**Benefit**: Honest assessment even when requirements incomplete

### 11. Quality Score Calculation (Quantitative Metric)

**Formula**: 100 - (20 Ã— FAILs) - (10 Ã— CONCERNS)

**Application**:
- NFR assessment score
- Gate file quality_score field

**Custom Weights**: Use `technical-preferences.md` if defined

**Benefit**: Quantitative quality tracking and comparison

### 12. QA-Only Story Permission (QA Results Section)

**CRITICAL**: QA can ONLY update QA Results section of story file

**Forbidden**: Status, Story, ACs, Tasks, Dev Notes, Testing, Dev Agent Record, Change Log, File List

**Rationale**:
- QA is advisory (doesn't set story status)
- Story owner decides final status
- Clear separation of concerns
- Prevents accidental overwrites

### 13. LLM-Accelerated Systematic Analysis

**Principle**: "Use LLMs to accelerate thorough yet focused analysis"

**Frameworks**:
- Test levels framework (unit/integration/E2E)
- Priorities matrix (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Risk assessment (six categories, probability Ã— impact)
- NFR assessment (core four with deterministic rules)
- GWT traceability

**Benefit**: LLM can execute sophisticated quality analysis consistently

### 14. Multi-Task Workflow (Review Orchestrates 6 Tasks)

**Comprehensive review workflow** (`*review`) orchestrates:
1. Risk profiling (`risk-profile.md`)
2. Test design (`test-design.md`)
3. Requirements traceability (`trace-requirements.md`)
4. NFR assessment (`nfr-assess.md`)
5. Gate decision (`qa-gate.md`)
6. Active refactoring (inline)

**Benefit**: Single command produces comprehensive quality analysis

### 15. Configuration-Driven Paths (No Hardcoded Locations)

**All paths** configured via `core-config.yaml`:
- `qa.qaLocation`: Base for gates and assessments
- `devStoryLocation`: Story files
- `architecture.architectureFile`: Architecture docs for NFR assessment
- `technicalPreferences`: Custom quality score weights

**Benefit**: Framework adapts to any project structure
