## 2. Core Principles

The Scrum Master agent operates according to fundamental guiding principles that shape story creation:

### 1. Rigorous Story Preparation Procedure
- Follow the `create-next-story` procedure exactly to generate detailed user stories
- Ensure all information comes from PRD and Architecture to guide the developer
- Extract and cite technical context from architecture documents systematically
- Never invent technical details not present in source documents

### 2. Complete Technical Context
- Provide sufficient context so developers NEVER need to read architecture documents
- Include all relevant data models, API specs, component details, and testing standards
- Extract previous story insights to inform current story preparation
- Document file locations, naming conventions, and project structure alignment

### 3. Source Citation Discipline
- Always cite source documents with specific section references
- Use format: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`
- Explicitly state when information is not found in architecture docs
- Maintain traceability from story details back to authoritative sources

### 4. Epic Sequencing Rules
- Always respect epic completion before moving to next epic
- Never automatically skip to another epic without explicit user instruction
- Verify previous story status before creating next story
- Alert users to incomplete stories and obtain override approval if needed

### 5. Developer-Centric Story Design
- Write stories assuming competent but context-limited developer agents
- Include tasks and subtasks with clear sequencing and acceptance criteria references
- Provide testing guidance aligned with project testing strategy
- Make stories self-contained with minimal external reference dependencies

### 6. Validation Through Checklists
- Execute story-draft-checklist to validate story completeness
- Assess goal clarity, technical guidance, reference effectiveness, and self-containment
- Recommend PO validation for complex stories before developer handoff
- Maintain quality gates to prevent incomplete stories from entering development

### 7. Change Management Discipline
- Use structured change-checklist for course correction scenarios
- Analyze impact on epics, artifacts, and MVP scope
- Draft specific proposed edits for affected artifacts
- Provide clear handoff paths for fundamental replanning needs

### 8. No Implementation Authority
- NEVER implement stories or modify code
- Role is strictly pre-development story preparation
- Developer agents own all code implementation work
- Scrum Master provides specifications, not solutions

## 3. Commands

The Scrum Master agent exposes 4 primary commands, all requiring the `*` prefix:

| Command | Description | Task/Template |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `*help` | Show numbered list of commands for selection | Built-in |
| `*draft` | Execute story creation workflow | `create-next-story.md` |
| `*story-checklist` | Execute story validation checklist | `execute-checklist.md` with `story-draft-checklist.md` |
| `*correct-course` | Execute change management workflow | `correct-course.md` |
| `*exit` | Say goodbye as Scrum Master and abandon persona | Built-in |

### Command Aliases and Natural Language Resolution
The agent performs flexible REQUEST-RESOLUTION matching:
- "draft story" ‚Üí `*draft` ‚Üí `create-next-story` task
- "validate story" ‚Üí `*story-checklist` ‚Üí `execute-checklist` + `story-draft-checklist`
- "handle change" ‚Üí `*correct-course` ‚Üí `correct-course` task

Users can type command names or numbers from help list for execution.

---

## 4. Dependencies

The Scrum Master agent relies on a carefully curated set of dependencies loaded on-demand when commands are executed.

### Tasks (3)
1. **`create-next-story.md`** - Primary 6-step story creation workflow
2. **`correct-course.md`** - Change management and course correction workflow
3. **`execute-checklist.md`** - Generic checklist execution framework

### Templates (1)
1. **`story-tmpl.yaml`** - Story document template (v2.0)
   - Defines story structure, sections, ownership, and edit permissions
   - Includes Status, Story statement, AC, Tasks, Dev Notes, Change Log, Dev Agent Record, QA Results

### Checklists (1)
1. **`story-draft-checklist.md`** - Story validation checklist
   - 5 categories: Goal & Context Clarity, Technical Implementation Guidance, Reference Effectiveness, Self-Containment Assessment, Testing Guidance
   - Embedded LLM instructions for validation methodology
   - Produces readiness assessment: READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED

### Configuration Files
- **`core-config.yaml`** - Loaded during story creation to determine:
  - `devStoryLocation` - Where story files are created
  - `prdSharded`, `prdShardedLocation`, `epicFilePattern` - Epic file locations
  - `architectureVersion`, `architectureSharded`, `architectureShardedLocation` - Architecture reading strategy
  - `devLoadAlwaysFiles` - Files developers always load (coding standards, tech stack, source tree)

---

## 5. Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create Next Story (*draft)

**Command**: `*draft`
**Task**: `create-next-story.md`
**Purpose**: Identify and prepare the next logical story with complete technical context

**Process Flow** (6 Sequential Steps - Do NOT proceed until current step is complete):

#### Step 0: Load Core Configuration and Check Workflow
1. Load `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` from project root
2. If file does not exist, HALT with detailed error and remediation options
3. Extract key configurations:
   - `devStoryLocation` - Story file output location
   - `prd.*` - PRD version, sharding status, location patterns
   - `architecture.*` - Architecture version, sharding status, location patterns
   - `workflow.*` - Workflow configurations

**Configuration Validation**: The agent will not proceed without `core-config.yaml`, ensuring all subsequent steps have proper context.

#### Step 1: Identify Next Story for Preparation
1. **Locate Epic Files**: Based on `prdSharded` configuration:
   - If sharded: Use `prdShardedLocation` + `epicFilePattern` (e.g., `docs/prd/epic-{n}*.md`)
   - If monolithic: Extract epic sections from monolithic PRD
2. **Review Existing Stories**: Check `devStoryLocation` for highest `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` file
3. **Determine Next Story**:
   - **If highest story exists**:
     - Verify status is 'Done'
     - If not 'Done': Alert user with current status and request override approval
     - If proceeding: Select next sequential story in current epic
     - If epic complete: Prompt user for explicit instruction on which story to create next
     - **CRITICAL**: NEVER automatically skip to another epic without user instruction
   - **If no story files exist**: Next story is ALWAYS 1.1 (first story of first epic)
4. **Announce Identified Story**: Inform user of `{epicNum}.{storyNum} - {Story Title}`

**Key Behaviors**:
- Epic completion detection: "Epic {epicNum} Complete: All stories in Epic {epicNum} have been completed. Would you like to: 1) Begin Epic {epicNum + 1} with story 1 2) Select a specific story to work on 3) Cancel story creation"
- Incomplete story handling: "ALERT: Found incomplete story! File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md Status: [current status] You should fix this story first, but would you like to accept risk & override to create the next story in draft?"

#### Step 2: Gather Story Requirements and Previous Story Context
1. **Extract Story Requirements**: Read identified epic file for story definition:
   - Story title and description
   - Acceptance criteria (numbered list)
   - Story-specific technical requirements or notes
2. **Review Previous Story** (if exists): Examine `Dev Agent Record` sections:
   - Completion Notes: Implementation outcomes and decisions
   - Debug Log References: Technical challenges encountered
   - Implementation Deviations: Where actual implementation diverged from plan
   - Lessons Learned: Insights that inform current story
3. **Extract Relevant Insights**: Identify patterns, challenges, or decisions that inform current story preparation

**Output**: Comprehensive understanding of what needs to be built and relevant historical context.

#### Step 3: Gather Architecture Context

**3.1 Determine Architecture Reading Strategy**

Based on configuration:
- **If `architectureVersion: >= v4` AND `architectureSharded: true`**:
  - Read `{architectureShardedLocation}/index.md` for document structure
  - Follow structured reading order based on story type
- **Else (monolithic architecture)**:
  - Use `architectureFile` for similar section extraction

**3.2 Read Architecture Documents Based on Story Type**

**For ALL Stories** (Universal Context):
- `tech-stack.md` - Technologies, frameworks, versions
- `unified-project-structure.md` - File organization, naming conventions
- `coding-standards.md` - Code style, patterns, best practices
- `testing-strategy.md` - Test approaches, frameworks, coverage requirements

**For Backend/API Stories** (Additional Context):
- `data-models.md` - Entity definitions, relationships, validation rules
- `database-schema.md` - Schema structure, indexes, migrations
- `backend-architecture.md` - Service layers, middleware, patterns
- `rest-api-spec.md` - Endpoint definitions, request/response formats
- `external-apis.md` - Third-party integrations, authentication

**For Frontend/UI Stories** (Additional Context):
- `frontend-architecture.md` - Component patterns, state management
- `components.md` - UI component specifications, props, behaviors
- `core-workflows.md` - User flows, navigation patterns
- `data-models.md` - Frontend data structures, validation

**For Full-Stack Stories**:
- Read BOTH Backend AND Frontend sections above

**3.3 Extract Story-Specific Technical Details**

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- Extract ONLY information directly relevant to implementing the current story
- Do NOT invent new libraries, patterns, or standards not in source documents
- ALWAYS cite source documents with specific sections
- If information not found, explicitly state: "No specific guidance found in architecture docs"

**Extract and Document**:
- **Data Models**: Specific schemas, validation rules, relationships [with source]
- **API Specifications**: Endpoint details, request/response formats, auth requirements [with source]
- **Component Specifications**: UI component details, props, state management [with source]
- **File Locations**: Exact paths where new code should be created based on project structure
- **Testing Requirements**: Specific test cases or strategies from testing-strategy.md
- **Security/Performance Considerations**: Constraints affecting the story
- **Technical Constraints**: Version requirements, dependencies, compatibility rules

**Citation Format**: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`

**Example**:
```
**Data Models**: The User entity includes fields: id (UUID), email (string, unique),
createdAt (timestamp). Email validation follows RFC 5322 standard.
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-entity]
```

#### Step 4: Verify Project Structure Alignment
1. Cross-reference story requirements with Project Structure Guide from `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`
2. Ensure file paths, component locations, and module names align with defined structures
3. Identify any structural conflicts or ambiguities
4. Document findings in "Project Structure Notes" section within story draft

**Validation Examples**:
- Backend endpoint location: Verify `src/api/routes/` vs `src/routes/api/`
- Component file naming: Verify `UserProfile.tsx` vs `user-profile.tsx`
- Test file location: Verify `tests/unit/` vs `src/__tests__/`

#### Step 5: Populate Story Template with Full Context

**5.1 Create Story File**
- Filename: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md`
- Template: Story Template v2.0 (`story-tmpl.yaml`)

**5.2 Fill Basic Story Information**
- **Title**: From epic definition
- **Status**: Draft
- **Story Statement**: "As a [role], I want [action], so that [benefit]" from epic
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Copy numbered list from epic file

**5.3 Populate Dev Notes Section (CRITICAL)**

**CRITICAL RULE**: This section MUST contain ONLY information extracted from architecture documents. NEVER invent or assume technical details.

**Organization** (by category):

1. **Previous Story Insights**
   - Key learnings from previous story implementation
   - Technical decisions that affect current story
   - Patterns established or challenges encountered

2. **Data Models**
   - Specific schemas, validation rules, relationships
   - Source references for each detail

3. **API Specifications**
   - Endpoint details, request/response formats
   - Authentication/authorization requirements
   - Source references for each detail

4. **Component Specifications**
   - UI component details, props, state management
   - Styling requirements, responsive behavior
   - Source references for each detail

5. **File Locations**
   - Exact paths where new code should be created
   - Based on project structure guide
   - Naming conventions to follow

6. **Testing Requirements**
   - Specific test cases or strategies
   - Test file locations and naming
   - Coverage requirements
   - From testing-strategy.md

7. **Technical Constraints**
   - Version requirements
   - Performance considerations
   - Security rules and compliance
   - Compatibility requirements

**Every technical detail MUST include source reference**: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`

**If information not found**: "No specific guidance found in architecture docs for [category]"

**5.4 Populate Testing Subsection**
Within Dev Notes, include dedicated Testing section:
- Test file location and naming conventions
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use
- Specific testing requirements for this story
- From architecture/testing-strategy.md

**5.5 Generate Tasks / Subtasks Section**
- Create detailed, sequential list of technical tasks
- Base tasks ONLY on: Epic Requirements, Story AC, Reviewed Architecture Information
- Each task must reference relevant architecture documentation
- Include unit testing as explicit subtasks based on Testing Strategy
- Link tasks to ACs where applicable: `Task 1 (AC: 1, 3)`

**Example**:
```
- [ ] Task 1: Create User entity model (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Define User schema with fields from data-models.md
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement email validation (RFC 5322)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Write unit tests for User model
- [ ] Task 2: Implement /api/users endpoint (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Create route handler per REST API spec
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Add authentication middleware
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Write integration tests
```

**5.6 Document Project Structure Notes**
Add notes on any project structure alignment issues or discrepancies found in Step 4.

#### Step 6: Story Draft Completion and Review
1. **Review All Sections**: Verify completeness and accuracy
2. **Verify Source References**: Ensure all technical details cite sources
3. **Validate Task Alignment**: Confirm tasks align with both epic requirements and architecture constraints
4. **Update Status**: Set to "Draft" and save story file
5. **Execute Story Draft Checklist**: Run `.bmad-core/tasks/execute-checklist` with `.bmad-core/checklists/story-draft-checklist`
6. **Provide User Summary**:
   - Story created: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md`
   - Status: Draft
   - Key technical components included from architecture docs
   - Any deviations or conflicts noted between epic and architecture
   - Checklist Results (READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED)
   - Next steps: For complex stories, suggest user carefully review the story draft and optionally have PO run `.bmad-core/tasks/validate-next-story`

**Decision Point**: Agent recommends PO validation for complex stories before developer handoff.

### Workflow 2: Story Validation Checklist (*story-checklist)

**Command**: `*story-checklist`
**Task**: `execute-checklist.md` with `story-draft-checklist.md`
**Purpose**: Validate story contains sufficient context for developer implementation

**Process Flow**:

#### Step 1: Initialization
1. Load story document being validated (from `devStoryLocation` or user-provided path)
2. Load parent epic context
3. Load referenced architecture or design documents
4. Load previous related stories if builds on prior work

**Validation Principles**:
- **Clarity**: Developer understands WHAT to build
- **Context**: Developer understands WHY and how it fits
- **Guidance**: Key technical decisions and patterns provided
- **Testability**: How to verify implementation works
- **Self-Contained**: Most info needed is in story itself

**Assumptions about Developer Agents**:
- Can research documentation and codebases
- Can make reasonable technical decisions
- Can follow established patterns
- Can ask for clarification when truly stuck

**Goal**: Check for SUFFICIENT guidance, not exhaustive detail

#### Step 2: Mode Selection
Ask user to choose:
- **Interactive Mode**: Work through checklist section by section (very time consuming)
- **YOLO Mode** (Recommended): Process all sections at once, present comprehensive report

#### Step 3: Execute 5 Validation Categories

**Category 1: Goal & Context Clarity**
- [ ] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [ ] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [ ] How story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [ ] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (if applicable)
- [ ] Business context and value are clear

**LLM Validation Focus**: Without clear goals, developers build the wrong thing. Verify story states WHAT functionality to implement, business value is clear, how it fits into larger epic/product, dependencies are explicit, success looks like something specific.

**Category 2: Technical Implementation Guidance**
- [ ] Key files to create/modify are identified (not necessarily exhaustive)
- [ ] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned
- [ ] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described
- [ ] Necessary data models or structures are referenced
- [ ] Required environment variables are listed (if applicable)
- [ ] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

**LLM Validation Focus**: Developers need enough technical context to start coding. Check key files/components are mentioned, technology choices specified where non-obvious, integration points identified, data models/API contracts defined or referenced, non-standard patterns called out.

**Category 3: Reference Effectiveness**
- [ ] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [ ] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (not just referenced)
- [ ] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [ ] References use consistent format (e.g., `docs/filename.md#section`)

**LLM Validation Focus**: References should help, not create treasure hunt. Ensure references point to specific sections (not whole documents), relevance explained, critical information summarized in story, references accessible (not broken links), previous story context summarized if needed.

**Category 4: Self-Containment Assessment**
- [ ] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [ ] Implicit assumptions are made explicit
- [ ] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained
- [ ] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed

**LLM Validation Focus**: Stories should be mostly self-contained to avoid context switching. Verify core requirements are in story (not just in references), domain terms explained or obvious, assumptions stated explicitly, edge cases mentioned (even if deferred), story could be understood without reading 10 other documents.

**Category 5: Testing Guidance**
- [ ] Required testing approach is outlined
- [ ] Key test scenarios are identified
- [ ] Success criteria are defined
- [ ] Special testing considerations are noted (if applicable)

**LLM Validation Focus**: Testing ensures implementation works. Check test approach specified (unit, integration, e2e), key test scenarios listed, success criteria measurable, special test considerations noted, acceptance criteria are testable.

#### Step 4: Generate Validation Report

**Report Structure**:

1. **Quick Summary**
   - Story readiness: READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED
   - Clarity score (1-10)
   - Major gaps identified

2. **Validation Table**

| Category | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity | PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL | [specific issues] |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL | [specific issues] |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness | PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL | [specific issues] |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment | PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL | [specific issues] |
| 5. Testing Guidance | PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL | [specific issues] |

3. **Specific Issues** (if any)
   - List concrete problems to fix
   - Suggest specific improvements
   - Identify any blocking dependencies

4. **Developer Perspective**
   - Could YOU implement this story as written?
   - What questions would you have?
   - What might cause delays or rework?

**Final Assessment**:
- **READY**: Story provides sufficient context for implementation
- **NEEDS REVISION**: Story requires updates (see issues)
- **BLOCKED**: External information required (specify what)

**Pragmatic Standard**: Perfect documentation doesn't exist, but it must be enough to provide the extreme context a dev agent needs to get the work done and not create a mess.

---

### Workflow 3: Course Correction (*correct-course)

**Command**: `*correct-course`
**Task**: `correct-course.md`
**Purpose**: Guide structured response to change triggers using change-checklist

**Process Flow**:

#### Step 1: Initial Setup & Mode Selection

**1.1 Acknowledge Task & Inputs**
- Confirm "Correct Course Task" (Change Navigation & Integration) is being initiated
- Verify change trigger and user's initial explanation of issue and perceived impact
- Confirm access to all relevant project artifacts:
  - PRD (epics/stories)
  - Architecture Documents
  - UI/UX Specifications
  - `.bmad-core/checklists/change-checklist`

**1.2 Establish Interaction Mode**
Ask user to choose:
- **Incrementally (Default & Recommended)**: Work through change-checklist section by section, discussing findings and collaboratively drafting proposed changes for each part before moving to next. Allows detailed, step-by-step refinement.
- **YOLO Mode (Batch Processing)**: Conduct batched analysis based on checklist, then present consolidated findings and proposed changes for broader review. Quicker for initial assessment but requires more extensive review.

Confirm selected mode and inform user: "We will now use the change-checklist to analyze the change and draft proposed updates. I will guide you through the checklist items based on our chosen interaction mode."

#### Step 2: Execute Checklist Analysis (Iteratively or Batched)

Systematically work through Sections 1-4 of change-checklist:

**Section 1: Change Context**
- What triggered this change?
- What is the nature of the change (scope, technical, timeline)?
- What is the current project state?

**Section 2: Epic/Story Impact Analysis**
- Which epics are affected?
- Which stories are affected (draft, in-progress, completed)?
- What is the severity of impact?

**Section 3: Artifact Conflict Resolution**
- Which project artifacts require updates (PRD, Architecture, Stories)?
- Are there inconsistencies to resolve?
- What cascading impacts exist?

**Section 4: Path Evaluation/Recommendation**
- What are potential solution paths? (adjust scope, rollback elements, re-scope features)
- What is the recommended path forward?
- Does this require fundamental replan by PM/Architect?

**For Each Checklist Item/Group** (depending on mode):
- Present relevant prompts or considerations from checklist
- Request necessary information and analyze relevant project artifacts
- Discuss findings with user
- Record status: `[x] Addressed`, `[N/A]`, `[!] Further Action Needed`
- Collaboratively agree on "Recommended Path Forward"

#### Step 3: Draft Proposed Changes (Iteratively or Batched)

Based on completed checklist analysis and agreed "Recommended Path Forward" (excluding scenarios requiring fundamental replans):

**3.1 Identify Affected Artifacts**
- Specific epics requiring updates
- User stories needing revision
- PRD sections needing changes
- Architecture document components needing updates
- Diagrams requiring modification

**3.2 Draft Proposed Changes Explicitly**

Examples of changes to draft:
- Revising user story text, acceptance criteria, or priority
- Adding, removing, reordering, or splitting user stories within epics
- Proposing modified architecture diagram snippets (updated Mermaid diagram or textual description)
- Updating technology lists, configuration details, or specific PRD/architecture sections
- Drafting new supporting artifacts if necessary (brief addendums for decisions)

**Interaction**:
- **Incremental Mode**: Discuss and refine proposed edits for each artifact or small group as drafted
- **YOLO Mode**: Compile all drafted edits for presentation in next step

#### Step 4: Generate "Sprint Change Proposal" with Edits

Synthesize complete change-checklist analysis (Sections 1-4) and all agreed-upon proposed edits into single document titled **"Sprint Change Proposal"**.

Aligns with Section 5 structure of change-checklist.

**Proposal Must Clearly Present**:

**Analysis Summary**:
- Concise overview of original issue
- Analyzed impact (on epics, artifacts, MVP scope)
- Rationale for chosen path forward

**Specific Proposed Edits**:
For each affected artifact, clearly show or describe exact changes:
- "Change Story X.Y from: [old text] To: [new text]"
- "Add new Acceptance Criterion to Story A.B: [new AC]"
- "Update Section 3.2 of Architecture Document as follows: [new/modified text or diagram description]"

Present complete draft of "Sprint Change Proposal" to user for final review and feedback. Incorporate final adjustments requested.

#### Step 5: Finalize & Determine Next Steps

**5.1 Obtain Approval**
- Obtain explicit user approval for "Sprint Change Proposal" including all specific edits

**5.2 Provide Deliverable**
- Provide finalized "Sprint Change Proposal" document to user

**5.3 Determine Next Actions**

**Based on approved changes**:

**If edits sufficiently address change and can be implemented directly**:
- State "Correct Course Task" is complete regarding analysis and change proposal
- User can proceed with implementing or logging changes (updating documents, backlog items)
- Suggest handoff to PO/SM agent for backlog organization if appropriate

**If analysis indicates change requires fundamental replan**:
- Clearly state this conclusion
- Advise user next step involves engaging primary PM or Architect agents
- Use "Sprint Change Proposal" as critical input and context for deeper replanning effort

**Output Deliverables**:
- **Primary**: "Sprint Change Proposal" document (markdown format) containing:
  - Summary of change-checklist analysis (issue, impact, rationale)
  - Specific, clearly drafted proposed edits for all affected artifacts
- **Implicit**: Annotated change-checklist (or record of completion) reflecting discussions, findings, decisions

- Change Log (to record changes)
- Dev Agent Record (exclusive ownership - all subsections)

**QA Agent Can Edit**:
- Change Log (to record QA activities)
- QA Results (exclusive ownership)

**Critical Rule**: Scrum Master CANNOT edit "Dev Agent Record" or "QA Results" sections.

## 7. Integration Points

### Handoffs TO Scrum Master

**From Product Manager (PM)**:
- **Artifacts**: Sharded PRD with epics (in `prdShardedLocation`)
- **Trigger**: PM completes PRD sharding, epics ready for story creation
- **Transition**: PM signals epics are approved, SM begins drafting stories from Epic 1

**From Product Owner (PO)**:
- **Artifacts**: Validation results from `validate-next-story` task
- **Trigger**: PO approves story draft OR identifies revisions needed
- **Transition**: If approved, story status ‚Üí "Approved" and ready for Dev Agent; if revisions needed, SM updates story based on PO feedback

**From User (Direct)**:
- **Trigger**: User requests story creation, change management, or validation
- **Commands**: `*draft`, `*correct-course`, `*story-checklist`

### Handoffs FROM Scrum Master

**To Product Owner (PO)**:
- **Artifacts**: Draft stories (Status: Draft)
- **Trigger**: SM completes complex story and recommends PO validation
- **Recommended Command**: User should have PO run `.bmad-core/tasks/validate-next-story`
- **Purpose**: PO validates story alignment with PRD and epic goals before developer handoff

**To Developer Agent (Dev)**:
- **Artifacts**: Approved stories (Status: Approved or Draft if validation skipped)
- **Trigger**: Story creation complete, optional PO validation passed
- **Transition**: Dev Agent receives story with complete technical context, begins implementation
- **Files Included**: Story file with Dev Notes containing all architecture extracts and source citations

**To Product Manager (PM) or Architect (Winston)**:
- **Artifacts**: Sprint Change Proposal indicating fundamental replan needed
- **Trigger**: Course correction analysis reveals change requires significant scope change or major architectural rework
- **Transition**: SM provides Sprint Change Proposal as input, PM/Architect leads replanning effort

**To QA Agent (Quinn)**:
- **Artifacts**: Story files with Dev Agent Record populated (Status: Review)
- **Trigger**: Dev Agent completes implementation, story ready for QA review
- **Note**: QA agent populates "QA Results" section, SM does not directly interact with QA during story lifecycle

### Shared Artifacts

**Epic Files** (Read-Only for SM):
- **Location**: `{prdShardedLocation}/epic-{n}*.md` or monolithic PRD
- **Created by**: PM agent during PRD sharding
- **Used by**: SM extracts story requirements, acceptance criteria, and sequencing rules

**Architecture Documents** (Read-Only for SM):
- **Location**: `{architectureShardedLocation}/*` (e.g., `docs/architecture/`)
- **Created by**: Architect agent
- **Used by**: SM extracts technical context for Dev Notes (data models, API specs, component details, testing strategy, project structure)

**Story Files** (Read-Write for SM, Dev, QA):
- **Location**: `{devStoryLocation}/*`
- **Created by**: SM agent
- **Updated by**: SM (initial creation), Dev (implementation sections), QA (results sections)
- **Section Ownership**: Enforced by template permissions

**Core Configuration** (Read-Only for SM):
- **Location**: `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
- **Created by**: Project setup or BMad installer
- **Used by**: SM reads to determine file locations, PRD/architecture versions, sharding status

### Workflow Dependencies

**Prerequisites for SM Operation**:
1. **Core Config Exists**: `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` must exist with proper configuration
2. **Epics Defined**: PRD must be sharded (or monolithic) with epic definitions available
3. **Architecture Documented**: Architecture documents must exist (sharded v4+ recommended)

**Sequential Workflow Position**:
```
PM (PRD Creation) ‚Üí PM (PRD Sharding) ‚Üí [PO Master Checklist] ‚Üí
‚Üí SM (Story Creation) ‚Üí [PO Story Validation] ‚Üí Dev (Implementation) ‚Üí QA (Review)
```

**Parallel Workflow Position** (Brownfield):
```
Analyst (Document Project) ‚Üí PM (Brownfield PRD) ‚Üí PM (Create Epics) ‚Üí
‚Üí SM (Story Creation) ‚Üí Dev (Implementation) ‚Üí QA (Review)
```

**Change Management Position**:
```
[Change Trigger] ‚Üí SM (Course Correction) ‚Üí Decision:
  ‚Üí If minor: SM drafts proposed changes ‚Üí PO/SM implements
  ‚Üí If major: Escalate to PM/Architect for replan
```

## 8. Special Features

### Feature 1: Intelligent Architecture Context Extraction

The SM agent implements sophisticated logic for extracting architecture context based on story type and architecture version.

**Architecture Version Detection**:
- **v4+ Sharded**: Read `{architectureShardedLocation}/index.md`, then selective document loading
- **Monolithic**: Read entire `architectureFile`, extract relevant sections

**Story Type Detection**:
The agent infers story type from epic definition and determines which architecture documents to read:

| Story Type | Architecture Documents Loaded |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **ALL** | tech-stack.md, unified-project-structure.md, coding-standards.md, testing-strategy.md |
| **Backend/API** | + data-models.md, database-schema.md, backend-architecture.md, rest-api-spec.md, external-apis.md |
| **Frontend/UI** | + frontend-architecture.md, components.md, core-workflows.md, data-models.md |
| **Full-Stack** | ALL Backend + ALL Frontend documents |

**Selective Extraction**: Only extracts information directly relevant to implementing current story (not entire documents).

**Source Citation Discipline**: Every extracted detail includes `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]` reference.

### Feature 2: Epic Sequencing and Completion Detection

The SM agent enforces strict epic sequencing rules to prevent work item disorder.

**Epic Completion Logic**:
1. Load highest story file from `devStoryLocation`
2. Check status of highest story
3. If status ‚â† 'Done': Alert user with current status, request override approval
4. If all stories in epic complete: Prompt user for explicit instruction on next story
5. NEVER automatically skip to next epic without user instruction

**User Prompts**:
- "Epic {epicNum} Complete: All stories in Epic {epicNum} have been completed. Would you like to: 1) Begin Epic {epicNum + 1} with story 1 2) Select a specific story to work on 3) Cancel story creation"
- "ALERT: Found incomplete story! File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md Status: [current status] You should fix this story first, but would you like to accept risk & override to create the next story in draft?"

**Purpose**: Maintains work item integrity, prevents cascade of incomplete work.

### Feature 3: Previous Story Context Integration

The SM agent reviews previous story implementation to inform current story preparation.

**Previous Story Analysis**:
1. Locate previous story file (highest `{epicNum}.{storyNum-1}.story.md`)
2. Read "Dev Agent Record" sections:
   - **Completion Notes**: Implementation outcomes, decisions made
   - **Debug Log References**: Technical challenges encountered
   - **Implementation Deviations**: Where actual implementation diverged from plan
   - **File List**: Files created/modified in previous story
3. Extract relevant insights for current story

**Integration into Current Story**:
- Include "Previous Story Insights" in Dev Notes section
- Highlight patterns established or challenges encountered
- Note technical decisions that affect current story
- Inform task breakdown based on previous story lessons

**Purpose**: Ensures continuity, prevents repeated mistakes, leverages established patterns.

### Feature 4: Project Structure Alignment Verification

The SM agent validates story requirements against project structure guide to prevent implementation confusion.

**Verification Process**:
1. Read `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md` (from architecture docs)
2. Cross-reference story requirements with defined structures:
   - File paths for new code
   - Component locations
   - Module names and organization
   - Naming conventions
3. Identify structural conflicts or ambiguities
4. Document findings in "Project Structure Notes" section

**Example Validations**:
- Backend endpoint location: `src/api/routes/` vs `src/routes/api/`
- Component file naming: `UserProfile.tsx` vs `user-profile.tsx`
- Test file location: `tests/unit/` vs `src/__tests__/`

**Conflict Documentation**:
```
**Project Structure Notes**:
- Epic specifies creating "auth middleware" but unified-project-structure.md
  defines middleware location as src/middleware/ (not src/api/middleware/).
- Recommend creating file: src/middleware/auth.ts
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#middleware]
```

**Purpose**: Prevents implementation time confusion, ensures consistency with project conventions.

### Feature 5: Story Self-Containment Optimization

The SM agent designs stories to be maximally self-contained, minimizing developer context switching.

**Self-Containment Strategies**:

1. **Complete Dev Notes**: All technical context extracted from architecture docs and included in story
2. **Source Citations**: Every detail cites source, but critical info is summarized in story
3. **Previous Story Context**: Key insights from previous story summarized (not just referenced)
4. **Domain Terms Explained**: Technical or domain-specific concepts defined in story
5. **Assumptions Made Explicit**: No implicit dependencies or assumptions
6. **Edge Cases Addressed**: Error scenarios and edge cases mentioned (even if deferred)

**Goal**: Developer should be able to implement story with minimal external document reading.

**Validation via Story Draft Checklist**:
- Category 4: Self-Containment Assessment
- Checklist item: "Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)"

**Quality Standard**: "Perfect documentation doesn't exist, but it must be enough to provide the extreme context a dev agent needs to get the work done and not create a mess."

### Feature 6: Change Management with Change-Checklist

The SM agent provides structured change management using `.bmad-core/checklists/change-checklist`.

**Change-Checklist Structure** (Sections 1-6):
1. **Change Context**: What triggered change, nature of change, current project state
2. **Epic/Story Impact Analysis**: Which epics/stories affected, severity of impact
3. **Artifact Conflict Resolution**: Which artifacts require updates, inconsistencies
4. **Path Evaluation/Recommendation**: Potential solutions, recommended path
5. **Sprint Change Proposal Format**: Template for documenting proposed changes
6. **Handoff Criteria**: When to escalate to PM/Architect

**Interaction Modes**:
- **Incremental**: Section-by-section discussion and refinement
- **YOLO**: Batched analysis, comprehensive report

**Output**: "Sprint Change Proposal" document with:
- Analysis summary (issue, impact, rationale)
- Specific proposed edits for affected artifacts
- Annotated change-checklist

**Escalation Logic**:
- If changes sufficiently address trigger: SM completes, PO/SM implements
- If fundamental replan needed: Escalate to PM/Architect with proposal as input

### Feature 7: Story Draft Quality Gates

The SM agent implements quality gates via `story-draft-checklist.md` to ensure stories meet minimum quality standards.

**5 Validation Categories**:
1. **Goal & Context Clarity** (5 items): Story purpose, epic relationship, system flow, dependencies, business value
2. **Technical Implementation Guidance** (6 items): Key files, technologies, APIs, data models, env vars, pattern exceptions
3. **Reference Effectiveness** (4 items): Specific section references, previous story summaries, relevance context, consistent format
4. **Self-Containment Assessment** (4 items): Core info included, assumptions explicit, domain terms explained, edge cases addressed
5. **Testing Guidance** (4 items): Test approach, scenarios, success criteria, special considerations

**Embedded LLM Instructions**:
Each category includes detailed LLM prompts for validation methodology, ensuring thorough and consistent checks.

**Validation Report**:
- Quick Summary: READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED
- Clarity score (1-10)
- Validation table with PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL per category
- Specific issues with concrete improvements
- Developer perspective: "Could YOU implement this as written?"

**Purpose**: Prevent incomplete or unclear stories from entering development, reducing rework and developer confusion.

### Feature 8: No Implementation Authority (Critical Constraint)

Unlike other agents, the SM agent has a strict prohibition on code implementation.

**Core Principle**: "You are NOT allowed to implement stories or modify code EVER!"

**Scope of Authority**:
- **CAN DO**: Draft stories, validate stories, manage epics, respond to changes, run checklists
- **CANNOT DO**: Implement stories, modify code, create production files, write tests, debug implementation

**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns between story preparation (SM) and implementation (Dev).

**Enforcement**:
- Persona instructions explicitly prohibit implementation
- Story template sections have ownership: Dev Agent owns "Dev Agent Record"
- Commands do not include any implementation tasks
- Agent greeting and help emphasize pre-development role

**User Communication**: If user requests implementation, SM must decline and redirect to Dev agent.

## 9. Configuration Requirements

### Core Configuration File (core-config.yaml)

**Location**: `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project root)
**Status**: **REQUIRED** - SM agent halts if not present

**Critical Configuration Fields**:

```yaml
# PRD Configuration
prd:
  prdFile: docs/prd.md                  # Monolithic PRD location (if not sharded)
  prdVersion: v4                        # PRD template version
  prdSharded: true                      # Whether PRD is sharded into epics
  prdShardedLocation: docs/prd          # Location of sharded epic files
  epicFilePattern: epic-{n}*.md         # Pattern for epic filenames

# Architecture Configuration
architecture:
  architectureFile: docs/architecture.md           # Monolithic arch location (if not sharded)
  architectureVersion: v4                          # Architecture template version
  architectureSharded: true                        # Whether architecture is sharded
  architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture   # Location of sharded arch docs

# Development Configuration
devStoryLocation: docs/stories          # Where story files are created
devLoadAlwaysFiles:                     # Files developers always load
  - docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
  - docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
  - docs/architecture/source-tree.md
devDebugLog: .ai/debug-log.md           # Debug log location

# Other Configuration
markdownExploder: true                  # Enable markdown tree parsing
qa:
  qaLocation: docs/qa                   # QA results location
customTechnicalDocuments: null          # Additional technical docs
slashPrefix: BMad                       # Slash command prefix
```

**Configuration Usage by SM**:

**Step 0 (Load Core Configuration)**:
- `devStoryLocation` ‚Üí Determine where to create story files
- `prdSharded`, `prdShardedLocation`, `epicFilePattern` ‚Üí Locate epic files
- `architectureVersion`, `architectureSharded`, `architectureShardedLocation` ‚Üí Determine architecture reading strategy

**Step 1 (Identify Next Story)**:
- `devStoryLocation` ‚Üí Check for existing story files
- `prdShardedLocation` + `epicFilePattern` ‚Üí Load epic files

**Step 3 (Gather Architecture Context)**:
- `architectureVersion` ‚Üí Determine if v4+ sharded or monolithic
- `architectureSharded` ‚Üí Determine reading strategy
- `architectureShardedLocation` ‚Üí Locate architecture documents

**Step 4 (Verify Project Structure)**:
- `architectureShardedLocation` + `unified-project-structure.md` ‚Üí Cross-reference file locations

**Configuration Validation**:
If `core-config.yaml` not found, SM halts with message:
```
"core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story creation.
You can either:
1) Copy it from GITHUB bmad-core/core-config.yaml and configure it for your project OR
2) Run the BMad installer against your project to upgrade and add the file automatically.
Please add and configure core-config.yaml before proceeding."
```

## 10. Architecture Reading Strategy (Critical Analysis)

The SM agent implements sophisticated architecture reading logic based on version and sharding status.

### Reading Strategy Decision Tree

```
IF architectureVersion >= v4 AND architectureSharded == true:
  ‚Üí Use Sharded v4+ Reading Strategy
  ‚Üí Read architectureShardedLocation/index.md
  ‚Üí Follow structured reading order based on story type
ELSE:
  ‚Üí Use Monolithic Reading Strategy
  ‚Üí Read architectureFile
  ‚Üí Extract relevant sections based on story type
```

### Sharded v4+ Reading Strategy (Recommended)

**Step 1: Read Index**
- File: `{architectureShardedLocation}/index.md`
- Purpose: Understand document structure, available sections

**Step 2: Universal Documents (ALL Stories)**
Load these documents for every story:
1. `tech-stack.md` - Technologies, frameworks, versions, dependencies
2. `unified-project-structure.md` - File organization, naming conventions, directory structure
3. `coding-standards.md` - Code style, patterns, best practices, conventions
4. `testing-strategy.md` - Test approaches, frameworks, coverage requirements, test organization

**Step 3: Story-Type-Specific Documents**

**Backend/API Story Detection** (look for keywords in epic: API, endpoint, service, backend, database, server):
Load additional documents:
5. `data-models.md` - Entity definitions, relationships, validation rules, business logic
6. `database-schema.md` - Schema structure, indexes, migrations, constraints
7. `backend-architecture.md` - Service layers, middleware, patterns, error handling
8. `rest-api-spec.md` - Endpoint definitions, request/response formats, authentication
9. `external-apis.md` - Third-party integrations, API keys, rate limits

**Frontend/UI Story Detection** (look for keywords in epic: UI, component, page, frontend, interface, view):
Load additional documents:
5. `frontend-architecture.md` - Component patterns, state management, routing, hooks
6. `components.md` - UI component specifications, props, behaviors, styling
7. `core-workflows.md` - User flows, navigation patterns, user interactions
8. `data-models.md` - Frontend data structures, validation, transformations

**Full-Stack Story Detection** (keywords from both Backend AND Frontend):
Load ALL documents:
- tech-stack.md, unified-project-structure.md, coding-standards.md, testing-strategy.md (universal)
- data-models.md, database-schema.md, backend-architecture.md, rest-api-spec.md, external-apis.md (backend)
- frontend-architecture.md, components.md, core-workflows.md (frontend)

**Step 4: Selective Extraction**
- Read loaded documents
- Extract ONLY information directly relevant to current story
- Cite every extracted detail: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`
- If category not found: "No specific guidance found in architecture docs for [category]"

### Monolithic Reading Strategy (Legacy)

**Step 1: Read Full Architecture File**
- File: `{architectureFile}` (e.g., `docs/architecture.md`)
- Load entire monolithic architecture document

**Step 2: Identify Relevant Sections**
Based on story type, extract content from sections:

**For ALL Stories**:
- Technology Stack section
- Project Structure section
- Coding Standards section
- Testing Strategy section

**For Backend/API Stories** (additional):
- Data Models section
- Database Schema section
- Backend Architecture section
- API Specifications section
- External APIs section

**For Frontend/UI Stories** (additional):
- Frontend Architecture section
- Components section
- User Workflows section

**For Full-Stack Stories**:
- ALL sections from Backend and Frontend

**Step 3: Extract and Cite**
- Same selective extraction and citation rules as sharded strategy

### Story Type Detection Logic

**Story type is inferred from epic definition and story requirements.**

**Detection Keywords**:

| Story Type | Keywords in Epic/Story |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Backend/API | api, endpoint, service, backend, database, server, schema, model, auth, middleware, route, controller |
| Frontend/UI | ui, component, page, frontend, interface, view, screen, form, button, layout, navigation, react, vue, angular |
| Full-Stack | (both backend AND frontend keywords present) |
| Unknown | (no clear indicators - prompt user or default to universal docs only) |

**Fallback**: If type unclear, load universal docs only and prompt user:
```
"Unable to determine story type (Backend, Frontend, or Full-Stack).
Please clarify so I can load the appropriate architecture documents."
```

### Citation Format and Discipline

**Every technical detail in Dev Notes MUST include source citation.**

**Citation Format**: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`

**Examples**:
```
**Data Models**: User entity includes fields: id (UUID), email (string, unique),
createdAt (timestamp). Email validation follows RFC 5322 standard.
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-entity]

**API Specifications**: POST /api/users endpoint accepts JSON payload with
email and password fields. Returns 201 Created with user object.
[Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#user-endpoints]

**Component Specifications**: UserProfile component receives userId prop (string),
fetches user data, displays avatar and bio. Uses React hooks for state management.
[Source: architecture/components.md#userprofile]
```

**When Information Not Found**:
```
**Security Considerations**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs for
authentication token expiration. Consider adding to architecture or consulting team.
```

**Purpose**: Maintains traceability, enables verification, prevents invention of technical details.

## 11. Epic Sequencing Rules and Story Conflict Resolution

The SM agent enforces strict sequencing rules to maintain work item integrity and epic completion discipline.

### Epic Sequencing Rules

**Rule 1: Sequential Story Creation Within Epic**
- Stories within an epic MUST be created sequentially: 1.1 ‚Üí 1.2 ‚Üí 1.3 ‚Üí ...
- Cannot skip story numbers (e.g., cannot create 1.3 before 1.2 is complete)

**Rule 2: Epic Completion Before Next Epic**
- All stories in Epic N must reach "Done" status before Epic N+1 can begin
- Agent detects epic completion by checking all story files in epic

**Rule 3: Explicit User Instruction for Epic Transitions**
- Agent NEVER automatically creates first story of next epic
- Upon epic completion, agent presents options:
  1. Begin Epic {epicNum + 1} with story 1
  2. Select a specific story to work on
  3. Cancel story creation
- User MUST provide explicit instruction

**Rule 4: Override Approval for Incomplete Stories**
- If previous story status ‚â† "Done", agent alerts user and requests override approval
- Override allows creation of next story despite incomplete previous story (risk accepted)

### Story Conflict Resolution

**Conflict Scenario 1: Incomplete Previous Story**

**Detection**:
- Agent loads highest story file: `{lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md`
- Checks status field
- If status ‚àà {Draft, Approved, InProgress, Review}, NOT "Done"

**Agent Action**:
```
ALERT: Found incomplete story!
File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md
Status: [current status: Draft/Approved/InProgress/Review]

You should fix this story first, but would you like to accept risk & override
to create the next story in draft?

Options:
1. Cancel - Fix incomplete story first (recommended)
2. Override - Create next story anyway (risk: work item disorder)
```

**User Choice**:
- Cancel: Agent halts, user addresses incomplete story
- Override: Agent proceeds with warning logged in story Change Log

**Conflict Scenario 2: Epic Complete, Next Story Undefined**

**Detection**:
- Agent determines all stories in current epic have "Done" status
- No clear next story within current epic

**Agent Action**:
```
Epic {epicNum} Complete: All stories in Epic {epicNum} have been completed.

Would you like to:
1. Begin Epic {epicNum + 1} with story 1
2. Select a specific story to work on (e.g., 2.3, 3.1)
3. Cancel story creation
```

**User Choice**:
- Option 1: Agent creates `{epicNum+1}.1.story.md`
- Option 2: Agent prompts for epic.story number, validates epic exists
- Option 3: Agent exits story creation workflow

**Conflict Scenario 3: No Story Files Exist (Initial State)**

**Detection**:
- `devStoryLocation` is empty or no `.story.md` files found

**Agent Action**:
- Automatically determine next story is 1.1 (first story of first epic)
- Announce: "No existing stories found. Creating first story: 1.1 - {Story Title}"

**No user prompt required** - this is the standard initial state.

**Conflict Scenario 4: User Requests Specific Story Out of Sequence**

**User Request**: "Create story 2.5"

**Agent Validation**:
1. Check if stories 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 exist
2. Check status of 2.4 (must be "Done")
3. Verify epic 2 exists in PRD

**Agent Action**:
- **If validation passes**: Create 2.5.story.md
- **If validation fails** (e.g., 2.4 incomplete):
  ```
  Cannot create story 2.5: Story 2.4 is incomplete (Status: InProgress).

  Options:
  1. Complete story 2.4 first (recommended)
  2. Accept risk & override to create 2.5
  ```

### Story Numbering Convention

**Format**: `{epicNum}.{storyNum}`
- `epicNum`: Epic number from PRD (1, 2, 3, ...)
- `storyNum`: Sequential story number within epic (1, 2, 3, ...)

**Examples**:
- `1.1` - First story of first epic
- `1.2` - Second story of first epic
- `2.1` - First story of second epic
- `3.7` - Seventh story of third epic

**File Naming**:
- Pattern: `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.{story_title_short}.md`
- Examples: `1.1.user-authentication.md`, `2.3.payment-gateway.md`

**Epic File Naming** (from PRD):
- Pattern: `epic-{n}*.md` (configurable via `epicFilePattern` in core-config.yaml)
- Examples: `epic-1-user-management.md`, `epic-2-payment-processing.md`

---

## 12. Dev Notes Section Population (Critical Implementation Detail)

The Dev Notes section is the **most critical section** of the story file, providing complete technical context for developer agents.

### Purpose and Philosophy

**Purpose**: Provide sufficient context so developers NEVER need to read architecture documents during implementation.

**Philosophy**:
- "Creating crystal-clear stories that dumb AI agents can implement without confusion"
- "Put enough information in this section so that the dev agent should NEVER need to read the architecture documents"
- "These notes along with the tasks and subtasks must give the Dev Agent the complete context it needs to comprehend with the least amount of overhead the information to complete the story, meeting all AC and completing all tasks+subtasks"

### Mandatory Rules

**Rule 1: No Invention**
- "Populate relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story"
- "Do not invent information"
- If information not found in architecture docs, explicitly state: "No specific guidance found in architecture docs for [category]"

**Rule 2: Source Citation Required**
- Every technical detail MUST include source reference
- Format: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`

**Rule 3: Complete Technical Context**
- Include ALL relevant data models, API specs, component details
- Include testing standards and requirements
- Include file locations and naming conventions
- Include previous story insights

**Rule 4: Self-Contained**
- Critical information must be in Dev Notes, not just referenced
- Minimize need for external document reading
- Summarize previous story context, don't just link

### Dev Notes Structure (Mandatory Categories)

#### Category 1: Previous Story Insights
**Purpose**: Provide continuity from previous story implementation

**Content**:
- Key learnings from previous story
- Technical decisions that affect current story

### Cloud Functions for Supporting Tasks

**Simple Task**: execute-checklist with story-draft-checklist

**Implementation**: Cloud Function (stateless validation)

```python
from google.cloud import functions_framework
import json

@functions_framework.http
def execute_story_checklist(request):
    """
    Validate story against story-draft-checklist.
    Returns validation report.
    """

    request_json = request.get_json()
    story = request_json["story"]
    checklist = request_json.get("checklist", "story-draft-checklist")

    # Load checklist
    checklist_content = load_checklist(checklist)

    # Execute 5 validation categories
    results = {
        "goal_clarity": validate_goal_clarity(story, checklist_content),
        "technical_guidance": validate_technical_guidance(story, checklist_content),
        "reference_effectiveness": validate_references(story, checklist_content),
        "self_containment": validate_self_containment(story, checklist_content),
        "testing_guidance": validate_testing(story, checklist_content)
    }

    # Generate validation report
    report = generate_validation_report(results)

    return json.dumps(report)
```

**Simple Task**: correct-course

**Implementation**: Could be Reasoning Engine (due to complexity) or Cloud Function with Firestore state

### Firestore Schema for Story Management

```
/projects/{project_id}
  - core_config: {core-config.yaml contents}
  - created_at: timestamp
  - status: "planning" | "development" | "complete"

/projects/{project_id}/epics/{epic_num}
  - title: string
  - description: string
  - story_count: int
  - content: {...}

/projects/{project_id}/stories/{epic_num}.{story_num}
  - epicNum: int
  - storyNum: int
  - title: string
  - status: "Draft" | "Approved" | "InProgress" | "Review" | "Done"
  - story_statement: string
  - acceptance_criteria: array

### Key ADK Translation Challenges

**Challenge 1: Sequential 6-Step Workflow with State**
- **Solution**: Use Reasoning Engine with state management
- **Reasoning**: create-next-story requires multi-step reasoning, conditional logic, user interaction points

**Challenge 2: Architecture Context Extraction Logic**
- **Solution**: Implement story type detection and document selection logic in Reasoning Engine
- **Reasoning**: Complex conditional logic based on configuration and story type

**Challenge 3: Source Citation Discipline**
- **Solution**: Implement citation tracking in Reasoning Engine, include in all extracted content
- **Reasoning**: Critical for traceability, must be enforced programmatically

**Challenge 4: User Interaction Points (Epic Transitions, Overrides)**
- **Solution**: Reasoning Engine returns "requires_user_input" status with options, agent presents to user, user response passed back as override parameter
- **Reasoning**: Cannot automatically proceed without explicit user instruction

**Challenge 5: File Operations (Read/Write Stories, Epics, Architecture)**
- **Solution**: Create dedicated Cloud Functions for file operations (read_epic, read_architecture, write_story), callable from Reasoning Engine
- **Reasoning**: Separation of concerns, reusable file operations

**Challenge 6: Template Population with Complex Logic**
- **Solution**: Implement template population logic in Reasoning Engine (7-category Dev Notes structure)
- **Reasoning**: Requires intelligent extraction and organization of architecture context

## 14. Comparison with Other Agents

### Similarities to PM Agent

**Shared Capabilities**:
- Both use `correct-course` task for change management
- Both work with epics (PM creates, SM consumes)
- Both use interactive and YOLO modes for workflows
- Both enforce validation via checklists

**Differences**:
- **Scope**: PM creates epics and PRD, SM creates stories from epics
- **Output**: PM creates high-level requirements, SM creates implementation-ready specifications
- **Architecture Interaction**: PM may update architecture, SM only reads architecture
- **User Interaction**: PM works in web UI (planning phase), SM works in IDE (development phase)

### Similarities to PO Agent

**Shared Capabilities**:
- Both validate work items (PO validates stories, SM drafts stories)
- Both use checklists for validation (PO: po-master-checklist and validate-next-story, SM: story-draft-checklist)
- Both ensure alignment between artifacts (PO: PRD-Architecture-Epic alignment, SM: Epic-Architecture-Story alignment)

**Differences**:
- **Role**: PO is validator/steward, SM is creator
- **Workflow Position**: SM creates stories ‚Üí PO validates stories
- **Checklist Focus**: PO checks cohesion across all artifacts, SM checks story completeness for implementation

### Similarities to Dev Agent

**Shared Capabilities**:
- Both work with story files
- Both read architecture documents
- Both operate in IDE (development phase)

**Differences**:
- **Implementation Authority**: SM CANNOT implement/modify code, Dev CAN
- **Story Section Ownership**: SM owns story creation sections, Dev owns Dev Agent Record section
- **Workflow Position**: SM creates stories ‚Üí Dev implements stories
- **Technical Depth**: SM extracts context from architecture, Dev makes implementation decisions

### Similarities to QA Agent

**Shared Capabilities**:
- Both execute checklists for validation
- Both work with completed stories
- Both add sections to story files (SM: initial sections, QA: QA Results)

**Differences**:
- **Timing**: SM creates stories before implementation, QA reviews after implementation
- **Validation Focus**: SM checks story readiness for development, QA checks implementation quality
- **Decision Authority**: SM has no gate authority, QA makes PASS/FAIL/CONCERNS decisions

### Unique Characteristics of SM Agent

**Uniquely SM**:
1. **Story Type Detection and Architecture Context Extraction**: No other agent implements this logic
2. **Epic Sequencing Enforcement**: Only SM enforces strict epic completion rules
3. **Dev Notes Population with Source Citations**: Only SM creates comprehensive implementation context
4. **Previous Story Context Integration**: Only SM reviews previous Dev Agent Record for insights
5. **Project Structure Alignment Verification**: Only SM validates story requirements against project structure guide
6. **No Implementation Authority**: Unique constraint - cannot modify code or create production files
7. **6-Step Sequential Story Creation Workflow**: Most complex story creation process in framework
8. **Bridge Between Planning and Development**: Only agent operating at transition between PM (planning) and Dev (implementation)

## 15. Summary

The Scrum Master (Bob) agent is a **highly specialized story preparation agent** operating at the critical transition point between high-level planning (PM/PO) and low-level implementation (Dev/QA).

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Role**: Technical Scrum Master - Story Preparation Specialist
- **Primary Function**: Convert epic definitions into implementation-ready stories with complete technical context
- **Core Workflow**: 6-step sequential create-next-story procedure with architecture context extraction
- **Critical Constraint**: CANNOT implement stories or modify code (pre-development role only)

**Most Complex Features**:
1. **Intelligent Architecture Context Extraction**: Story type detection, document selection (v4+ sharded vs monolithic), selective extraction with source citations
2. **Epic Sequencing Enforcement**: Strict story ordering, epic completion detection, explicit user approval for transitions
3. **Comprehensive Dev Notes Population**: 7-category structure extracting all relevant technical context so developers never need to read architecture docs
4. **Story Quality Gates**: 5-category validation via story-draft-checklist ensuring stories are READY for implementation

**Integration Position**:
```
PM (Epic Creation) ‚Üí SM (Story Creation) ‚Üí PO (Story Validation - optional) ‚Üí
‚Üí Dev (Implementation) ‚Üí QA (Review)
```

**Unique Value**:
SM agent ensures developers receive **crystal-clear, self-contained, context-rich stories** that enable efficient implementation with minimal confusion, rework, or external document reading. This is critical for AI developer agents that may lack broader project context.

**ADK Translation**: Requires Reasoning Engine for complex 6-step workflow with state, conditional logic, and user interaction points. Supporting tasks (file operations, checklist validation) implemented as Cloud Functions. Firestore for story state management, Cloud Storage for artifact storage.
