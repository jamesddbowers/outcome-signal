#### Template Identity

```yaml
template:
  id: brainstorming-output-template-v2
  name: Brainstorming Session Results
  version: 2.0
  output:
    format: markdown
    filename: docs/brainstorming-session-results.md
    title: "Brainstorming Session Results"
```

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Lines**: 157
- **Owner**: Analyst Agent (Mary)
- **Mode**: **Non-interactive** (unique among planning templates)
- **Purpose**: Capture and organize brainstorming ideas and insights after facilitation session
- **Output**: Single markdown file at docs/brainstorming-session-results.md

---

#### Unique Workflow: Non-Interactive

```yaml
workflow:
  mode: non-interactive
```

**What This Means**:
- Template does NOT guide elicitation conversation
- Agent generates output AFTER brainstorming session completes
- No user interaction during document generation
- Automated output based on session data

**Design Insight**: This template is used by `facilitate-brainstorming-session.md` task. The Analyst facilitates brainstorming using a separate workflow, then uses this template to generate the results document automatically.

---

#### Purpose & Context

**Brainstorming in BMad Framework**:
1. Analyst (Mary) facilitates brainstorming session with user
2. Various ideation techniques applied (SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, etc.)
3. Ideas, insights, and connections captured during session
4. After session, Analyst generates brainstorming-session-results.md document
5. Document feeds into project-brief or PRD creation

**Relationship to Other Templates**:
- **Created by**: facilitate-brainstorming-session.md task
- **Informs**: project-brief-tmpl (ideas feed into brief)
- **Optional**: Not all projects need brainstorming session

---

#### Section Structure

The template captures comprehensive session output across 6 main sections:

---

#### Section 1: Header (Metadata)

**Content Block** (fixed structure):
```markdown
**Session Date:** {{date}}
**Facilitator:** {{agent_role}} {{agent_name}}
**Participant:** {{user_name}}
```

**Example**:
```markdown
**Session Date:** 2024-05-15
**Facilitator:** Research Analyst Mary
**Participant:** James Bowers
```

**Design Insight**: Metadata provides traceability—who participated, when, who facilitated.

**Design Insight**: Themes synthesize ideas into higher-level patterns—helps identify focus areas.

---

#### Section 3: Technique Sessions (Repeatable)

**Purpose**: Document results from each brainstorming technique applied.

**Repeatable**: `repeatable: true` - One section per technique

**Sub-section: Technique**

**Title Pattern**: "{{technique_name}} - {{duration}}"

**Sub-sub-sections**:

1. **Description**
   - Template: `"**Description:** {{technique_description}}"`
   - What the technique is and how it was applied

2. **Ideas Generated** (numbered-list)
   - Template: `"{{idea}}"`
   - All ideas from this technique
   - Numbered for reference

3. **Insights Discovered** (bullet-list)
   - Template: `"- {{insight}}"`
   - Learnings and realizations from technique
   - Meta-insights about problem/solution space

4. **Notable Connections** (bullet-list)
   - Template: `"- {{connection}}"`
   - Relationships between ideas
   - How ideas combine or build on each other

**Example**:

```markdown
### SCAMPER Technique - 15 minutes

**Description:** Applied SCAMPER framework (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse) to existing task management patterns.

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Substitute synchronous meetings with async video updates attached to tasks
2. Combine task tracking with automatic time zone conversion
3. Adapt gamification from Duolingo for consistent task completion
4. Modify notification system to respect deep work hours
5. Put calendar blocking to other use: auto-block time for task execution
6. Eliminate status update meetings by making task progress ambient
7. Reverse typical push notifications: pull-based "check when ready" model

**Insights Discovered:**
- Many meeting inefficiencies stem from timezone coordination—async by default could be transformative
- Notification fatigue is a major pain point—need to rethink push model
- Gamification works for individual tasks but may not fit team dynamics

**Notable Connections:**
- Ideas 2 and 4 combine well: timezone-aware notification suppression
- Ideas 5 and 6 address same root cause: invisible work time
- Reverse notification model (idea 7) could solve notification fatigue (insight 2)
```

**Design Insight**: Structured technique documentation enables learning—what techniques worked well, what insights emerged.

---

#### Section 4: Idea Categorization

**Purpose**: Organize all ideas by implementation timeline and ambition level.

**Sub-sections**:

---

**1. Immediate Opportunities**

**Content**: "Ideas ready to implement now"

**Type**: numbered-list (repeatable)

**Template**:
```markdown
**{{idea_name}}**
- Description: {{description}}
- Why immediate: {{rationale}}
- Resources needed: {{requirements}}
```

**Example**:
```markdown
1. **Timezone Badge on Task Cards**
   - Description: Show teammate's current local time and availability status on task assignments
   - Why immediate: Simple UI addition, no backend complexity, high value
   - Resources needed: Frontend developer (2-4 hours), timezone library integration
```

**Design Insight**: "Immediate" means low-hanging fruit—quick wins that can be implemented in MVP.

---

**2. Future Innovations**

**Content**: "Ideas requiring development/research"

**Type**: numbered-list (repeatable)

**Template**:
```markdown
**{{idea_name}}**
- Description: {{description}}
- Development needed: {{development_needed}}
- Timeline estimate: {{timeline}}
```

**Example**:
```markdown
1. **AI Workload Predictor**
   - Description: Machine learning model predicts how long tasks will take based on historical data and developer patterns
   - Development needed: ML model training, historical data collection, accuracy validation
   - Timeline estimate: 3-6 months post-launch
```

**Design Insight**: "Future" means valuable but not MVP—requires more time, research, or foundational work.

---

**3. Moonshots**

**Content**: "Ambitious, transformative concepts"

**Type**: numbered-list (repeatable)

**Template**:
```markdown
**{{idea_name}}**
- Description: {{description}}
- Transformative potential: {{potential}}
- Challenges to overcome: {{challenges}}
```

**Example**:
```markdown
1. **Ambient Team Awareness System**
   - Description: Virtual office space with real-time ambient indicators of team member status (deep work, available for questions, offline) using ML to detect work patterns from task activity
   - Transformative potential: Completely eliminates need for "are you available?" interruptions while maintaining team cohesion. Could redefine remote collaboration.
   - Challenges to overcome: Privacy concerns with activity tracking, accuracy of ML detection, cultural adoption of new collaboration paradigm
```

**Design Insight**: "Moonshots" are big bets—high risk, high reward. May never be implemented, but represent vision.

---

**4. Insights & Learnings**

**Content**: "Key realizations from the session"

**Type**: bullet-list

**Template**: `"- {{insight}}: {{description_and_implications}}"`

**Example**:
- "Async-first is more than features: It's a culture shift that requires careful onboarding and team buy-in"
- "Notification fatigue is universal: Every participant mentioned being overwhelmed by app notifications"
- "Trust is the barrier: Users nervous about AI assigning their work, need transparency and override controls"
- "Timezone pain is underestimated: Coordination across time zones adds 5-10 hours per week of overhead"

**Design Insight**: Insights inform product strategy beyond features—culture, trust, pain points.

---

#### Section 5: Action Planning

**Purpose**: Translate ideas into actionable next steps.

**Sub-section: Top 3 Priority Ideas**

**Structure**: Three sub-sub-sections for priorities 1-3

**Priority Template** (for each):
```markdown
### #1 Priority: {{idea_name}}

- Rationale: {{rationale}}
- Next steps: {{next_steps}}
- Resources needed: {{resources}}
- Timeline: {{timeline}}
```

**Example**:

```markdown
### #1 Priority: Timezone-Aware Task Assignment

- Rationale: Solves the most painful problem (coordination overhead), simple to implement, clear differentiator from competitors
- Next steps:
  1. Validate with 10 potential users that this is high-value
  2. Design timezone detection and assignment algorithm
  3. Create mockups for timezone UI elements
  4. Include in MVP scope for PRD
- Resources needed: PM (design feature), UX Expert (mockups), Architect (algorithm design)
- Timeline: 2 weeks to validate and design, ready for development sprint 2
```

**Design Insight**: Action planning bridges brainstorming to execution—top ideas get concrete next steps.

## Comprehensive Summary: Core Planning Templates

### Template Collection Overview

The BMad framework's 6 core planning templates form a comprehensive system for project initiation, requirements gathering, and development planning:

| Template | Lines | Owner | Mode | Primary Purpose | Key Innovation |
|----------|-------|-------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| brainstorming-output | 157 | Analyst | non-interactive | Capture ideation results | Automated doc generation |
| project-brief | 223 | Analyst | interactive + custom | Project foundation | YOLO mode, custom actions |
| prd | 204 | PM | interactive | Greenfield requirements | Epic/story hierarchy |
| brownfield-prd | 282 | PM | interactive | Enhancement requirements | Compatibility reqs (CR), Integration verification (IV) |
| front-end-spec | 351 | UX Expert | interactive | UI/UX design | Mermaid diagrams, accessibility-first |
| story | 139 | SM | interactive | Story definition | Section ownership model |
| **Total** | **1,356** | **5 agents** | **2 modes** | **Complete planning** | **Multi-agent collaboration** |

---

### Key Design Patterns Across Templates

#### 1. **Template-Driven Development**

All templates follow consistent structure:
- YAML metadata (ID, version, output)
- Workflow configuration (mode, elicitation)
- Hierarchical section definitions
- Variable interpolation
- Agent instructions

**Benefit**: Consistent, repeatable process across all projects.

---

#### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**

Templates guide information gathering incrementally:
- Start with executive summary
- Drill into details section-by-section
- User not overwhelmed with all questions at once
- Agent confirms understanding before proceeding

**Benefit**: Reduces cognitive load, improves quality of responses.

---

#### 3. **Context Preservation**

All templates include:
- Change logs tracking modifications
- Metadata (version, author, date)
- Cross-references to related documents
- Traceability from requirements to implementation

**Benefit**: Complete audit trail, enables impact analysis.

---

#### 4. **Quality by Design**

Templates enforce quality standards:
- Required vs. optional sections
- Validation rules (e.g., SMART goals)
- Examples providing concrete reference
- Checklists ensuring completeness

**Benefit**: Consistent quality across all projects.

---

#### 5. **Agent-Centric Instructions**

Every section includes instructions for agents:
- What information to gather
- How to elicit information
- What quality standards to apply
- When to confirm understanding

**Benefit**: Templates are executable specifications, not just documentation.

---

#### 6. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** (v2.0)

Story template introduces ownership model:
- Section owners and editors defined
- Exclusive, collaborative, and multi-agent sections
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Conflict prevention

**Benefit**: Safe concurrent editing by multiple specialized agents.

---

### Critical Innovations

#### 1. **Section Ownership Model** (story-tmpl)

**Problem**: Multiple agents need to work on same story without conflicts.

**Solution**: Section-level ownership and edit permissions.

**Impact**:
- SM owns requirements (Story, AC)
- Dev owns implementation record
- QA owns review results
- Prevents overwrites and conflicts
- Enables true multi-agent collaboration

**ADK Translation**: Firestore security rules enforce permissions.

---

#### 2. **Brownfield-Specific Enhancements** (brownfield-prd-tmpl)

**Problem**: Enhancing existing projects requires different approach than greenfield.

**Solution**: Additional sections and validation:
- Compatibility Requirements (CR)
- Integration Verification (IV) per story
- Risk assessment with technical debt
- Scope assessment to prevent over-engineering
- Explicit validation confirmations

**Impact**:
- Ensures existing system integrity
- Minimizes risk of breaking changes
- Acknowledges technical debt
- Right-sizes effort for enhancement complexity

**ADK Translation**: Integration with document-project task outputs.

---

#### 3. **YOLO Mode** (project-brief-tmpl)

**Problem**: Section-by-section elicitation can be slow when user has clear vision.

**Solution**: Agent generates complete draft for review.

**Impact**:
- Much faster brief creation (minutes vs. hours)
- User refines draft iteratively
- Still maintains quality through review
- Alternative to lengthy elicitation

**ADK Translation**: GPT-4 or Claude Opus for high-quality generation.

---

#### 4. **Custom Elicitation Actions** (project-brief-tmpl)

**Problem**: Standard question-answer elicitation can be rigid.

**Solution**: User-selectable actions for each section:
- "Validate against similar products"
- "Challenge scope from MVP minimalist view"
- "Brainstorm creative possibilities"
- "What if we had [resource]..."

**Impact**:
- Flexible, creative exploration
- Adaptive questioning based on context
- More engaging interaction
- Better insights

**ADK Translation**: Action menu triggers specialized agent behaviors.

---

#### 5. **Mermaid Diagram Integration** (front-end-spec-tmpl)

**Problem**: Visual documentation requires external tools.

**Solution**: Mermaid diagrams embedded in markdown.

**Impact**:
- Site maps and user flows as diagrams
- No external tool dependencies
- Version controlled with spec
- Rendered in markdown viewers

**ADK Translation**: mermaid.js for rendering, Firestore for storage.

---

#### 6. **Context Curation for AI Agents** (story-tmpl Dev Notes)

**Problem**: AI agents have limited context windows.

**Solution**: SM extracts relevant architecture sections into Dev Notes.

**Impact**:
- Dev Agent has complete context without reading full architecture
- Prevents context overflow
- Improves implementation quality
- Faster development

**ADK Translation**: Semantic search + SM curation workflow.
