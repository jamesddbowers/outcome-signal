## Issues & Findings

### Critical Issues: 0 ❌
None found.

### Major Issues: 0 ⚠️
None found.

### Minor Issues: 0 ℹ️
None found.

### Observations & Enhancements: 3 💡

1. **Enhancement Opportunity**: Glossary of Terms
   - **Severity**: Nice-to-have
   - **Description**: While terminology is used consistently, a glossary would help readers unfamiliar with the framework
   - **Recommendation**: Consider adding in Phase 6 (final deliverables)
   - **Impact**: Low - documentation is clear without it

2. **Enhancement Opportunity**: Troubleshooting Section
   - **Severity**: Nice-to-have
   - **Description**: Common issues and solutions could be documented
   - **Recommendation**: Add during Phase 2 as agents are analyzed in detail
   - **Impact**: Low - can be added later

3. **Enhancement Opportunity**: Mermaid Diagrams
   - **Severity**: Nice-to-have
   - **Description**: ASCII diagrams are excellent; Mermaid.js could enhance Phase 6 ADK design
   - **Recommendation**: Consider for Phase 6 when designing ADK architecture
   - **Impact**: Low - ASCII diagrams are sufficient for current phase
