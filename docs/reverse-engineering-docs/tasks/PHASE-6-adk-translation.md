## Phase Overview

Phase 6 synthesizes all previous analysis to design a comprehensive translation plan for implementing BMad using **Google's Agent Development Kit (Google ADK)** and Google Cloud Platform services.

**About Google ADK**: Google's Agent Development Kit (google-adk) is Google's official open-source framework for building AI agents. Throughout this document, "ADK" refers specifically to Google ADK, not generic frameworks. See [../adk-design/architecture-design.md](../adk-design/architecture-design.md) for detailed architecture using Google ADK.

This phase produces the final architecture design, agent configurations, workflow implementations, and deployment guides.

## Objectives

- Design complete ADK architecture
- Create agent configuration specifications for all 10 agents
- Implement Reasoning Engine workflow definitions
- Design API specifications for agent interactions
- Create storage schema design (Firestore + Cloud Storage)
- Produce deployment guide and infrastructure-as-code
- Create migration strategy from file-based to cloud-based system

## Critical Design Decisions

### Agent Morphing vs Static Agents
**Challenge**: BMad-Orchestrator dynamically morphs into any agent. Vertex AI agents are statically defined.
**Options**:
1. Meta-agent that loads different personas dynamically
2. Orchestrator service that routes to appropriate static agents
3. Hybrid: Static agents with dynamic prompt loading

### File-Based vs Cloud-Based State
**Challenge**: BMad uses markdown files for state. ADK needs cloud storage.
**Options**:
1. Full migration to Firestore (structured) + Cloud Storage (documents)
2. Hybrid: Keep markdown for readability, sync to cloud for processing
3. Markdown-first: Generate cloud artifacts from canonical markdown files

### Reasoning Engine vs Cloud Workflows
**Challenge**: Complex decision logic needs intelligent execution.
**Options**:
1. Vertex AI Reasoning Engine for all complex workflows (native GCP service)
2. Cloud Workflows for orchestration + Functions for decisions
3. Hybrid: Vertex AI Reasoning Engine for complex logic, Workflows for coordination

### Template Rendering
**Challenge**: YAML-in-markdown templates need server-side rendering.
**Options**:
1. Cloud Function template service
2. Embedded in agent tools
3. Separate template management service

## Notes

- Phase 6 is the culmination of all previous analysis phases
- Design decisions should prioritize GCP best practices and cost efficiency
- Infrastructure-as-code ensures reproducible deployments
- Migration strategy enables gradual transition from file-based to cloud
- All agent configurations should reference completed agent analysis documents
- Workflow implementations should reference completed task analysis documents
- Architecture design should synthesize all framework understanding
