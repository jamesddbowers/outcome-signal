**Key Findings:**
- **Risk Assessment Framework**: 6 categories (TECH, SEC, PERF, DATA, BUS, OPS) ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Probability × Impact Scoring**: 3×3 matrix produces objective 1-9 risk scores (9=Critical, 6=High, 4=Medium, 2-3=Low, 1=Minimal)
- **Deterministic Gate Mapping**: Critical (9) → FAIL, High (6) → CONCERNS, else PASS (unless waived)
- **Risk Score Calculation**: Base 100 - (20×Critical) - (10×High) - (5×Medium) - (2×Low), floor 0, ceiling 100
- **Triple Output Generation**: Gate YAML block (for gate file) + Markdown report (comprehensive documentation) + Story hook line (for QA Results reference)
- **3-Type Mitigation Strategies**: Preventive (stop risk), Detective (detect occurrence), Corrective (minimize damage) with specific actions, testing requirements, residual risk, owner, timeline
- **Risk Category Specifics**: Each category has subcategories and examples (TECH: architecture complexity, integration; SEC: auth/authz, injection; PERF: response time, throughput; DATA: loss, corruption; BUS: user needs, revenue; OPS: deployment, monitoring)
- **7-Step Workflow**: Load story → Identify risks (by category) → Assess probability/impact → Prioritize (risk matrix) → Generate mitigations → Generate outputs → Integrate with gate

**Blockers:**
None.

**Notes:**
- Dev agent has 6 commands, 3 tasks, 1 template, 1 checklist
- Dev is the IMPLEMENTATION SPECIALIST - executes approved stories with precision and testing
- Unique constraint: Story-contained context - NEVER loads PRD/architecture docs (beyond devLoadAlwaysFiles)
- Minimal context loading strategy:
  - devLoadAlwaysFiles (3 files): coding-standards.md, tech-stack.md, source-tree.md
  - Story file with complete Dev Notes section
  - No PRD or full architecture docs loaded
  - Benefits: Reduced token usage, faster execution, lower hallucination risk
- Strict permission model - Dev can ONLY update:
  - Tasks/Subtasks checkboxes
  - Dev Agent Record (all subsections) - EXCLUSIVE owner
  - Change Log (append entries)
  - Status (only when ready for review/done)
- Blocking condition protocol - 5 automatic HALT scenarios:
  1. Unapproved dependencies needed → confirm with user
  2. Ambiguous requirements → ask for clarification
  3. 3 failures attempting same fix → escalate (avoid infinite loops)
  4. Missing configuration → request config
  5. Failing regression → investigate root cause
- Sequential task execution discipline:
  1. Read next task
  2. Implement task + subtasks
  3. Write tests
  4. Execute validations
  5. ONLY if ALL pass → mark [x]
  6. Update File List
  7. Repeat
- Test-first approach: "DON'T BE LAZY - EXECUTE ALL TESTS and CONFIRM"
- DoD checklist: 7 categories (Requirements, Coding Standards, Testing, Functionality, Story Admin, Dependencies/Build, Documentation)
- QA fix prioritization: High severity → NFR FAIL → NFR CONCERNS → Coverage gaps (P0 first) → Trace gaps → Risk must_fix → Medium → Low
- Status setting logic after QA fixes: Gate PASS + gaps closed → "Ready for Done", otherwise → "Ready for Review" (triggers re-review)
- Dev never modifies QA gate files - QA maintains gate ownership
- Educational command (*explain): Teaches users about implementation decisions "as if training junior engineer"
- Critical workflow rule: Story must be approved (not Draft) before implementation begins
- ADK Translation: Requires Reasoning Engine for complex sequential task execution, QA fix application, DoD validation
