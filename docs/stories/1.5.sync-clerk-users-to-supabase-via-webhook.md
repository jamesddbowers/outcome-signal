# Story 1.5: Sync Clerk Users to Supabase via Webhook

**Status:** Done

---

## Story

**As a** system,
**I want** to automatically create Supabase user records when users sign up in Clerk,
**so that** user data is synced between auth and database.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Clerk webhook endpoint created in Next.js API route (`/api/webhooks/clerk`)
2. Webhook listens for `user.created` event
3. On user creation, insert record into Supabase `users` table
4. Webhook verifies Clerk signature for security
5. Handle duplicate user creation gracefully (idempotent)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 1.3 (Clerk Authentication):**
- ✅ Clerk authentication fully integrated with JWT tokens
- ✅ Environment variable pattern established (`.env.local` for secrets)
- ✅ Clerk user ID format: `user_<random_string>` (e.g., `user_2abc123def`)
- ✅ Clerk provides `useUser()` hook on frontend, returns `clerk_user_id`

**From Story 1.4 (Supabase Setup):**
- ✅ Supabase `users` table created with schema:
  - `id` UUID PRIMARY KEY
  - `clerk_user_id` TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
  - `email` TEXT NOT NULL
  - `first_name`, `last_name`, `avatar_url` (nullable)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` TIMESTAMPTZ
- ✅ Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled on `users` table
- ✅ RLS policies use `auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'` to extract Clerk user ID from JWT
- ✅ Supabase clients available: browser client (anon key), server client (service_role key)

**Key Integration Point:**
- This story bridges Clerk authentication (Story 1.3) and Supabase database (Story 1.4)
- After this story, Clerk sign-up will automatically create Supabase user records
- Future stories can reference `users.id` via Supabase foreign keys

---

### Architecture Context

#### Clerk Webhook Integration
[Source: [architecture/7-external-apis-third-party-integrations.md#71-clerk-authentication](../architecture/7-external-apis-third-party-integrations.md#71-clerk-authentication)]

**Purpose:** Sync user data from Clerk to Supabase database

**Webhook Events:**
- `user.created` ← **This story**
- `user.updated` (Future: Story 1.6+)
- `user.deleted` (Future: Story 1.6+)

**Webhook Flow:**
```
Clerk Sign-Up → Clerk fires user.created webhook → Next.js API Route → Supabase users table
```

**Security:**
- Clerk signs webhook payloads with HMAC SHA-256
- Signature verification prevents unauthorized webhook calls
- Webhook secret must be kept secure (server-side only)

---

#### Webhook Signature Verification with svix
[Source: [architecture/7-external-apis-third-party-integrations.md#71-clerk-authentication](../architecture/7-external-apis-third-party-integrations.md#71-clerk-authentication)]

**Package:** `svix` (Clerk's official webhook verification library)

**Signature Headers:**
- `svix-id` - Unique message ID
- `svix-timestamp` - Unix timestamp (prevents replay attacks)
- `svix-signature` - HMAC signature of payload

**Verification Example:**
```typescript
import { Webhook } from 'svix';

const wh = new Webhook(process.env.CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET!);
const payload = wh.verify(body, {
  'svix-id': headers.get('svix-id'),
  'svix-timestamp': headers.get('svix-timestamp'),
  'svix-signature': headers.get('svix-signature'),
});
```

**Important:** Signature verification requires the **raw request body** as a string. Do not parse JSON before verification.

---

#### Next.js API Route Structure for Webhooks
[Source: [architecture/11-backend-architecture-details.md#111-nextjs-api-routes-pattern](../architecture/11-backend-architecture-details.md#111-nextjs-api-routes-pattern)]

**File Location:** `apps/web/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`

**Route Handler Pattern:**
```typescript
export async function POST(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  // 1. Extract headers
  // 2. Read raw body
  // 3. Verify signature
  // 4. Parse payload
  // 5. Process event
  // 6. Return 200 OK
}
```

**Key Differences from Standard API Routes:**
- **No Clerk auth middleware** (webhooks come from Clerk, not authenticated users)
- **Raw body required** for signature verification (do not use `request.json()` immediately)
- **Return 200 OK** even for handled errors (Clerk retries non-200 responses)

---

#### Supabase Admin Client Pattern
[Source: [architecture/7-external-apis-third-party-integrations.md#74-supabase](../architecture/7-external-apis-third-party-integrations.md#74-supabase)]

**Why Admin Client?**
- Webhook runs without authenticated user context
- RLS policies require authenticated user (JWT with `sub` claim)
- Admin client uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to **bypass RLS**

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!, // Bypasses RLS
  { auth: { persistSession: false } }
);
```

**Security Note:** Service role key has **full database access**. Only use in server-side API routes, never expose to client.

---

#### Clerk Webhook Payload Structure
[Source: [architecture/7-external-apis-third-party-integrations.md#71-clerk-authentication](../architecture/7-external-apis-third-party-integrations.md#71-clerk-authentication)]

**Event Type:** `user.created`

**Payload Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "user.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "user_2abc123def",
    "email_addresses": [
      {
        "email_address": "user@example.com",
        "id": "email_abc123"
      }
    ],
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "image_url": "https://img.clerk.com/...",
    "created_at": 1234567890
  }
}
```

**Field Mapping:**
| Clerk Field | Supabase Field | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| `data.id` | `clerk_user_id` | Unique Clerk user ID |
| `data.email_addresses[0].email_address` | `email` | Primary email |
| `data.first_name` | `first_name` | Nullable |
| `data.last_name` | `last_name` | Nullable |
| `data.image_url` | `avatar_url` | Nullable |

---

#### Environment Variables for Webhooks
[Source: [architecture/12-deployment-architecture.md#122-environment-variables](../architecture/12-deployment-architecture.md#122-environment-variables)]

**New Environment Variable:**
- `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (secret, server-side only) - Webhook signing secret from Clerk dashboard

**Existing Environment Variables (required for this story):**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (public) - Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (secret, server-side only) - Admin access to Supabase

**File Location:**
- Development: `apps/web/.env.local` (add `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in this story)
- Production: Vercel dashboard (Story 9.x - Launch Prep)

---

#### Idempotent Webhook Processing
[Source: [architecture/11-backend-architecture-details.md](../architecture/11-backend-architecture-details.md)]

**Why Idempotency?**
- Clerk retries webhooks on failure or timeout
- Network issues can cause duplicate webhook deliveries
- Webhook handler must be **idempotent** (safe to call multiple times)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Attempt to insert user record into Supabase
2. If unique constraint violation (duplicate `clerk_user_id`), query existing record
3. Compare existing data with webhook data
4. If data matches, return 200 OK (already processed)
5. If data differs, update existing record (Clerk data changed)

**Error Code:** PostgreSQL unique constraint violation is error code `23505`

---

#### Error Handling and Logging
[Source: [architecture/11-backend-architecture-details.md](../architecture/11-backend-architecture-details.md)]

**Logging Requirements:**
- Log all successful user creations
- Log duplicate user handling (for observability)
- Log signature verification failures (security concern)
- Log Supabase insertion errors

**Return Status Codes:**
- `200 OK` - Successful processing (including handled duplicates)
- `400 Bad Request` - Missing required headers or invalid payload
- `401 Unauthorized` - Signature verification failed
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Unexpected errors

**Important:** Always return `200 OK` after successful processing. Clerk retries non-200 responses, which can cause duplicate processing attempts.

---

#### Testing Strategy for Webhooks
[Source: [architecture/14-testing-strategy.md](../architecture/14-testing-strategy.md)]

**Unit Tests (Vitest):**
- Test webhook signature verification (valid and invalid signatures)
- Test event parsing and validation
- Test user data mapping from Clerk to Supabase
- Test idempotent duplicate handling
- Mock Supabase client and svix Webhook class

**Integration Tests:**
- Test full webhook flow from HTTP request to database insertion
- Use real svix library to generate test signatures
- Use test Supabase database for verification
- Test duplicate user creation scenario

**Test File Location:**
- Unit tests: `apps/web/app/api/webhooks/clerk/__tests__/route.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/app/api/webhooks/clerk/__tests__/integration.test.ts`

---

#### TypeScript Types for Clerk Webhooks
[Source: [architecture/15-coding-standards.md#151-typescript-standards](../architecture/15-coding-standards.md#151-typescript-standards)]

**Type Safety Requirements:**
- Define TypeScript interface for Clerk `user.created` event payload
- Explicit return types for all functions (`Promise<Response>`)
- Use `unknown` for webhook payload before type validation
- Type guard functions for event validation

**Example Type Definition:**
```typescript
interface ClerkUserCreatedEvent {
  type: 'user.created';
  data: {
    id: string;
    email_addresses: Array<{
      email_address: string;
      id: string;
    }>;
    first_name: string | null;
    last_name: string | null;
    image_url: string | null;
    created_at: number;
  };
}
```

---

#### Project Structure for Webhooks
[Source: [architecture/10-frontend-architecture-details.md#101-nextjs-app-router-structure](../architecture/10-frontend-architecture-details.md#101-nextjs-app-router-structure)]

**This story adds:**
```
apps/web/app/api/
└── webhooks/
    └── clerk/
        ├── route.ts                    # Webhook handler (NEW)
        └── __tests__/
            ├── route.test.ts           # Unit tests (NEW)
            └── integration.test.ts     # Integration tests (NEW)
```

**Alignment with Architecture:** Webhook routes follow Next.js API Routes convention. No conflicts detected.

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
[Source: [architecture/14-testing-strategy.md](../architecture/14-testing-strategy.md)]

**Testing Framework:** Vitest (Jest-compatible, already configured in Story 1.2)

**Unit Testing Requirements:**
- Target: >80% coverage for API routes
- Test webhook signature verification
- Test event parsing and validation
- Test Supabase user creation logic
- Mock external dependencies (Supabase, svix)

**Integration Testing Requirements:**
- Test full webhook flow with real svix library
- Test database insertion with test Supabase instance
- Verify idempotent behavior with duplicate requests

**Test File Location:**
- Unit tests: `apps/web/app/api/webhooks/clerk/__tests__/route.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/app/api/webhooks/clerk/__tests__/integration.test.ts`

---

#### Testing Approach for This Story

**Unit Tests (Vitest):**
1. Mock svix `Webhook` class to simulate signature verification
2. Mock Supabase admin client to isolate webhook logic
3. Test successful `user.created` event processing
4. Test signature verification failures
5. Test missing required headers or fields
6. Test duplicate user handling (idempotent behavior)
7. Test non-`user.created` event types

**Integration Tests (Vitest):**
1. Use real svix library to generate valid test signatures
2. Use test Supabase database (or mock with in-memory SQLite)
3. Send POST request to webhook route handler
4. Verify user record created in database
5. Send duplicate request and verify idempotent behavior

**Manual Testing:**
1. Configure webhook in Clerk dashboard (development)
2. Use ngrok or similar to expose localhost webhook endpoint
3. Create test user in Clerk dashboard
4. Verify webhook fires and user created in Supabase
5. Create same user again and verify no duplicate error

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Executive Summary

**Gate Status:** ✅ **PASS** - Production-ready implementation with exceptional quality

Story 1.5 demonstrates outstanding software engineering practices with comprehensive security, robust error handling, and exceptional test coverage. This implementation sets a high quality standard for future webhook integrations.

**Quality Score:** 95/100

---

### Code Quality Assessment

#### Strengths
- **Security-First Design**: Proper webhook signature verification using svix library prevents unauthorized webhook calls
- **Type Safety**: Explicit TypeScript interfaces for Clerk webhook events with proper type guards
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 500)
- **Idempotent Design**: Gracefully handles duplicate webhooks through PostgreSQL unique constraint handling
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns (verification → validation → database operations)
- **Observability**: Comprehensive console logging for all code paths (success, duplicates, errors)
- **Environment Validation**: Proper validation of required environment variables

#### Code Structure Analysis
The webhook handler follows a clear, logical flow:
1. Extract and validate required headers (svix-id, svix-timestamp, svix-signature)
2. Verify webhook signature using svix library
3. Validate event type (process user.created, ignore others)
4. Extract and validate user data fields
5. Create Supabase admin client (bypasses RLS)
6. Attempt database insertion
7. Handle duplicate gracefully (idempotent behavior)

**Implementation Quality:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent

---

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring was required.** The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with:
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Clean function structure with explicit return types
- Well-organized error handling
- Appropriate use of architectural patterns

**Future Considerations** (not blocking):
- When implementing additional webhook events (user.updated, user.deleted in Story 1.6+), consider extracting signature verification logic to a shared utility function
- Consider adding structured logging with correlation IDs for enhanced production traceability
- Consider implementing webhook replay capability for development/debugging

---

### Security Review

#### Security Strengths ✅
1. **Webhook Signature Verification**: Uses industry-standard svix library to verify Clerk webhook signatures, preventing unauthorized webhook calls
2. **Environment Variable Validation**: Validates CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET exists before processing
3. **Service Role Key Isolation**: Properly uses SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY server-side only (never exposed to client)
4. **Raw Body Reading**: Correctly reads raw request body for signature verification (prevents payload tampering)
5. **Appropriate Error Codes**: Returns proper HTTP status codes without leaking sensitive information
6. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all required fields (user ID, email)
7. **Database Security**: Leverages Supabase admin client to bypass RLS appropriately for webhook context

#### Security Assessment
**Status:** ✅ **PASS** - Production-ready security implementation

**Findings:** No security concerns identified. The implementation follows webhook security best practices and properly isolates secrets.

**Recommendations:**
- Monitor webhook signature verification failures in production (potential attack indicator)
- Ensure CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET is properly secured in production environment (Vercel environment variables)
- Consider implementing rate limiting for webhook endpoint (future enhancement, not blocking)

---

### Performance Considerations

#### Performance Profile
- **Webhook Handler Complexity:** O(1) - Single database operation for success case
- **Database Operations:**
  - Success path: 1 INSERT query
  - Duplicate path: 1 INSERT + 1 SELECT + 1 UPDATE (only on duplicate)
- **Processing Time:** Lightweight processing with minimal compute

#### Performance Assessment
**Status:** ✅ **PASS** - No performance concerns

**Analysis:**
- Webhook handler is optimized for speed with minimal processing
- Database queries are indexed (clerk_user_id has unique constraint/index)
