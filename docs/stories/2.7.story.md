## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 2.6 (Responsive Design):**
- E2E testing framework with Playwright is comprehensive and well-established
- Visual regression testing with screenshot comparison is available
- WCAG accessibility compliance is critical (touch targets, keyboard navigation)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` media query must be respected for accessibility
- WorkspaceShell.tsx has three responsive layouts: mobile tabs (<768px), tablet drawer (768px-1023px), desktop panels (≥1024px)
- All components use shadcn/ui primitives (Tabs, Sheet, Button)

**From Story 2.5 (Phase Indicator):**
- Responsive patterns established: `md:hidden`, `hidden md:flex`, `lg:block`

**From Story 2.1 (Three-Column Layout):**
- `react-resizable-panels` library used for panel resizing
- Panel widths persist to localStorage via `autoSaveId="workspace-layout"`
- Collapse/expand functionality implemented with Panel refs
- Current panels: Left (20% default, 15% min), Middle (flex-grow), Right (collapsible)

### Component Architecture

**[Source: [6-components-architecture.md#6.1](docs/architecture/6-components-architecture.md#6.1)]**

Main workspace components:
```
apps/web/components/workspace/
├── WorkspaceShell.tsx       # MODIFY - Add panel animations
├── LeftPanel.tsx            # No changes needed
├── MiddlePanel.tsx          # VERIFY - Document reflow behavior
├── RightPanel.tsx           # No changes needed
└── PhaseIndicator.tsx       # No changes needed
```

**[Source: [6-components-architecture.md#6.2](docs/architecture/6-components-architecture.md#6.2)]**

Responsive behavior (already implemented):
- Desktop (≥1024px): Three columns visible with collapse buttons
- Tablet (768px-1023px): Left drawer (Sheet), middle + right visible
- Mobile (<768px): Single column with Tabs navigation

### Animation Implementation Strategy

**[Source: Epic 2, Story 2.7 Technical Notes]**

- **CSS Transitions:** Use native CSS transitions (no Framer Motion needed for simple transitions)
- **Duration:** 200ms for all collapse/expand animations
- **Easing:** `ease-in-out` timing function
- **Performance:** Animate `transform` and `opacity` properties (GPU-accelerated)
- **Accessibility:** Disable all animations when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active

**CSS Transitions Implementation:**

```css
/* Add to WorkspaceShell.tsx or global CSS */
.panel-transition {
  transition: width 200ms ease-in-out, opacity 200ms ease-in-out;
}

/* Accessibility: Respect reduced motion preference */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .panel-transition {
    transition: none;
  }
}
```

**[Source: [3-tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md)]**

- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS 3.4+ with JIT compiler
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- **Panel Library:** react-resizable-panels (already in use)

**Note:** Framer Motion is mentioned in Epic 2.7 technical notes as an option, but is NOT listed in the tech stack. Prefer native CSS transitions for better performance and smaller bundle size.

### React Resizable Panels Animation

**[Source: WorkspaceShell.tsx current implementation]**

The `react-resizable-panels` library handles resize animations internally. We need to:
1. Verify the Panel component supports smooth transitions during collapse/expand
2. Add CSS transitions to enhance visual feedback
3. Ensure collapse/expand state changes trigger smooth animations

**Current Panel Implementation:**
```tsx
<Panel
  ref={leftPanelRef}
  id="left"
  defaultSize={20}
  minSize={15}
  collapsible
  collapsedSize={4}
  className="relative hidden lg:block"
  onCollapse={() => setIsLeftCollapsed(true)}
  onExpand={() => setIsLeftCollapsed(false)}
/>
```

**Enhancement Needed:**
- Add Tailwind transition utilities to Panel className
- Verify react-resizable-panels respects CSS transitions
- Add transitions to content inside panels (opacity fade)

### Accessibility: `prefers-reduced-motion`

**[Source: Epic 2, Story 2.7 AC #4]**

Users with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity can enable "Reduce Motion" in their OS settings. This sets the `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media query to `reduce`.

**Implementation:**
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

**Testing:**
- macOS: System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion
- Windows: Settings > Ease of Access > Display > Show animations
- Browser DevTools: Emulate media feature `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`

### Shadcn/UI Component Animations

**[Source: [3-tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md)]**

shadcn/ui components (Tabs, Sheet) have built-in Radix UI animations:

**Sheet (Tablet Drawer):**
- Uses Radix Dialog with slide-in animation
- Default animation: 200ms ease-out
- Automatically respects `prefers-reduced-motion` via Radix

**Tabs (Mobile):**
- Uses Radix Tabs with fade animation
- Tab content transitions smoothly
- Active indicator animates with slide

**Action Required:** Verify these animations match 200ms ease-in-out specification. Override if necessary.

### Performance Considerations

**[Source: Epic 2, Story 2.7 AC #3]**

**No Layout Shift or Jank:**
- Use `transform` instead of `width` for animations (GPU-accelerated)
- Add `will-change: transform` to elements that animate frequently
- Avoid animating `width` or `height` on elements with complex children
- Test with Chrome DevTools Performance tab (aim for 60fps)

**Document Preview Reflow:**
- TipTap editor must handle width changes smoothly
- Ensure editor content doesn't overflow during transitions
- Test with long documents (100+ pages)

### File Locations

**Files to Modify:**
- `apps/web/components/workspace/WorkspaceShell.tsx` - Add panel collapse/expand animations
- `apps/web/app/globals.css` - Add `prefers-reduced-motion` media query and transition utilities

**New Test Files:**
- `apps/web/components/workspace/__tests__/WorkspaceShell-animations.test.tsx` - Unit tests for animation behavior

**Existing Test Files to Update:**
- `apps/web/e2e/responsive-workspace.spec.ts` - Add E2E tests for smooth animations

**No Database Changes Required**

### Testing Strategy

**[Source: [14-testing-strategy.md#14.2](docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md#14.2)]**

**Unit Testing (Vitest):**
- Test collapse/expand state changes
- Mock `window.matchMedia` for `prefers-reduced-motion` testing
- Verify transition classes are applied to DOM elements
- Test animation duration matches specification

**[Source: [14-testing-strategy.md#14.4](docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md#14.4)]**

**E2E Testing (Playwright):**
- Test visual smoothness of animations (screenshot comparison)
- Emulate `prefers-reduced-motion` in Playwright
- Verify animations complete before next interaction
- Test on multiple viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

**Manual Testing:**
- Test with browser reduced motion settings
- Test with OS-level accessibility settings (macOS/Windows)
- Profile animations with Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Test on low-end devices or throttled CPU

### Technical Constraints

**[Source: [3-tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md)]**

- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS 3.4+ (use transition utilities)
- **Animation Library:** Prefer native CSS transitions (no Framer Motion in tech stack)
- **Component Library:** shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives (built-in animations)

**[Source: [15-coding-standards.md](docs/architecture/15-coding-standards.md)]**

- All TypeScript strict mode rules apply
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Follow component structure: imports, props, component, hooks, handlers, render

**Animation Duration Standard:**
- Collapse/Expand: 200ms ease-in-out
- Hover states: 150ms ease-in-out
- Active states: 100ms ease-in-out

**No specific guidance found in architecture docs for:**
- Animation performance profiling standards
- Framer Motion usage (not in tech stack - use CSS transitions)

## Testing

**[Source: [14-testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md)]**

### Unit Testing Requirements

**Test Framework:** Vitest + React Testing Library

**Test File Location:** `apps/web/components/workspace/__tests__/WorkspaceShell-animations.test.tsx`

**Required Tests:**
1. Panel collapse triggers `isLeftCollapsed` state change
2. Panel expand triggers `isLeftCollapsed` state change to false
3. Transition classes are applied to Panel elements
4. `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables transitions
5. Animation duration matches 200ms specification

**Example Test Pattern:**
```typescript
describe('WorkspaceShell animations', () => {
  it('applies transition classes to panels', () => {
    render(<WorkspaceShell initiativeId="test-id" />);
    const leftPanel = screen.getByTestId('left-panel');
    expect(leftPanel).toHaveClass('transition-all', 'duration-200', 'ease-in-out');
  });

  it('respects prefers-reduced-motion', () => {
    // Mock matchMedia to return prefers-reduced-motion: reduce
    Object.defineProperty(window, 'matchMedia', {
      writable: true,
      value: jest.fn().mockImplementation(query => ({
        matches: query === '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)',
        media: query,
        onchange: null,
        addListener: jest.fn(),
        removeListener: jest.fn(),
      })),
    });

    render(<WorkspaceShell initiativeId="test-id" />);
    const leftPanel = screen.getByTestId('left-panel');
    expect(leftPanel).not.toHaveClass('transition-all');
  });
});
```

### E2E Testing Requirements

**Test Framework:** Playwright

**Test File Location:** Add to existing `apps/web/e2e/responsive-workspace.spec.ts`

**Required Tests:**
1. Left panel collapse animation completes smoothly (desktop)
2. Right panel collapse animation completes smoothly (desktop)
3. Panel resize animation during drag (desktop)
4. Tablet drawer animation (768px-1023px)
5. Mobile tab switching animation (<768px)
6. Visual regression with screenshot comparison
7. `prefers-reduced-motion` emulation test

**Example E2E Test Pattern:**
```typescript
test.describe('Panel Animations', () => {
  test.use({ viewport: { width: 1440, height: 900 } }); // Desktop

  test('left panel collapses with smooth animation', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/dashboard/initiatives/test-id');

    // Click collapse button
    const collapseButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: /collapse left/i });
    await collapseButton.click();

    // Wait for animation to complete (200ms + buffer)
    await page.waitForTimeout(300);

    // Verify panel is collapsed
    const leftPanel = page.getByTestId('left-panel');
    expect(await leftPanel.getAttribute('data-collapsed')).toBe('true');

    // Visual regression check
    await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('left-panel-collapsed.png');
  });

  test('respects prefers-reduced-motion', async ({ page, context }) => {
    // Emulate reduced motion preference
    await context.emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: 'reduce' });

    await page.goto('/dashboard/initiatives/test-id');

    // Click collapse button
    const collapseButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: /collapse left/i });
    await collapseButton.click();

    // Panel should collapse instantly (no animation delay)
    const leftPanel = page.getByTestId('left-panel');
    expect(await leftPanel.getAttribute('data-collapsed')).toBe('true');
  });
});
```
