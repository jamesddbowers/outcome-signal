# Project Brief: OutcomeSignal

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Author:** Mary (Business Analyst Agent)
**Status:** Ready for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary

**Project Name:** OutcomeSignal

**Product Concept:** An intelligent SDLC orchestration platform that uses specialized AI agents to guide users through complete software project lifecycles—from ideation through production-ready specifications—while naturally teaching best practices through opinionated workflows.

**Primary Problem:** Software teams struggle to maintain comprehensive, consistent documentation across the SDLC. Analysis artifacts (briefs, research) don't properly cascade into planning documents (PRDs, architecture), creating gaps that lead to miscommunication, scope creep, and failed projects. Current tools are either too rigid (Jira, Linear—great for execution, poor for upfront planning) or too freeform (Notion, Confluence—flexible but provide no guidance or structure).

**Target Market:**
- **Primary:** Solo developers, indie hackers, and small teams (2-10 people) who need professional-grade project planning but lack dedicated PMs/architects
- **Secondary:** Digital agencies managing multiple client projects requiring standardized documentation
- **Tertiary:** Visual/no-code developers using platforms like Lovable, v0, Base 44
- **Expansion:** ChatGPT/Claude Desktop users seeking structured workflows, BMAD Method enthusiasts, and teams already using Linear/Jira who want intelligent agent-driven planning

**Key Value Proposition:** A single AI agent that orchestrates 8 specialized sub-agents (Analysis + Planning phases) to create and maintain all upstream project documentation. The platform enforces the proven Initiative → Epic → Feature → Story → Task hierarchy while intelligently meeting users where they are—if you start discussing features, it recognizes the gap and backfills missing Initiative/Brief artifacts. Three-column UI provides visual hierarchy, live document preview, and agent chat in one unified workspace.

**System-of-Record Architecture:** OutcomeSignal integrates with Linear, Jira, Notion, and Azure Boards, allowing users to pull existing artifacts or create new ones in both systems simultaneously. OutcomeSignal always remains the system of record, preserving full context even if users switch platforms—providing platform migration safety and multi-platform support.

## Problem Statement

### Current State: The Planning Gap

Most software projects fail not during implementation, but during planning—or more accurately, due to lack of proper planning. Teams jump straight into execution tools (Jira stories, Linear issues) without establishing clear strategic context. This creates:

**Pain Points:**
- **Disconnected artifacts:** Market research exists in Notion, PRD in Google Docs, architecture in Confluence, stories in Linear—no single source of truth
- **Lost context:** 6 months into development, no one remembers *why* architectural decisions were made
- **Scope creep:** Without clear Initiative/Epic boundaries, features get added reactively without strategic evaluation
- **Onboarding nightmare:** New team members face fragmented documentation across 5+ tools
- **Rework cycles:** Implementation discovers gaps in requirements, forcing costly backtracking

**Quantified Impact:**
- Studies show 70% of software projects fail due to poor requirements (Standish Group)
- Average team spends 8-12 hours/week searching for context across documentation silos
- Agencies report 30-40% of billable hours lost to rework from unclear requirements

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

| Tool Type | Strength | Gap |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| **Jira/Linear** | Excellent for execution tracking | Assumes planning is already done; provides no upstream guidance |
| **Notion/Confluence** | Flexible documentation | Too freeform—no structure or relationships between docs |
| **Traditional PM tools** | Enforce process | Rigid templates; no intelligence to adapt or guide |
| **AI coding assistants** | Great at code generation | No understanding of strategic context or document relationships |

**Why Now?**

1. **AI agent orchestration is newly viable:** Multi-agent systems with tool use only became practical in 2024
2. **Remote work amplifies the problem:** Distributed teams need better async documentation practices
3. **ChatGPT Apps SDK + MCP:** Distribution channels to reach 800M+ users without building marketplace presence from scratch

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept: Your AI Planning Team

OutcomeSignal provides a single AI agent that orchestrates specialized sub-agents behind the scenes to generate all planning documentation—from business idea to ready-to-build backlog. Users review, refine, and approve rather than starting from a blank page.

### The Three-Column Workspace

└─────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Single Agent, Two Phases

Users interact with **one AI agent** that internally orchestrates specialized sub-agents across two planning phases:

```
USER ──> OutcomeSignal Agent
              │
              ├─ PHASE 1: ANALYSIS
              │  ├── Analyst (brainstorming, discovery)
              │  ├── Market Research
              │  └── Competitive Analysis
              │
              └─ PHASE 2: PLANNING
                 ├── PM (PRD, requirements)
                 ├── Architect (tech stack, data models)
                 ├── UX (flows, wireframes)
                 ├── Security (threat modeling)
                 └── QA (test strategy)
```

### Example Interaction

```
User: "I want to build a healthcare scheduling app"

Agent: "Great! I'll help you plan this properly. Let me start by
       creating a project brief to capture the core concept.

       First, tell me: Who is this for—patients, providers, or both?"

[User provides context through conversation]

Agent: "I've drafted an executive summary and problem statement.
       Take a look in the middle column. Would you like to refine
       anything before I move to competitive analysis?"

[Agent internally coordinated Analyst sub-agent to draft content]

User: "Looks good, proceed"

Agent: "I'm researching competitors like Zocdoc, Solv, and Healthie.
       I'll draft a competitive analysis showing how your solution
       differentiates..."

[Agent internally invokes Competitive Analysis sub-agent]
```

### Key Differentiators

1. **Orchestrated Sub-Agents:** One conversational interface, eight specialized experts working behind the scenes
2. **Intelligent Backfilling:** Jump to features? Agent recognizes missing Initiative/Brief and backfills it
3. **Opinionated Workflow:** Initiative → Epic → Feature → Story → Task hierarchy prevents scope chaos
4. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Agent drafts, human reviews and approves—never fully autonomous
5. **Unified Workspace:** Hierarchy navigation, live document preview, agent chat—all in one view
6. **Integration-First with System-of-Record Architecture:**
   - **Pull existing artifacts** into Linear, Jira, Notion, Azure Boards (one-way sync to external tools)
   - **Create new in both systems** simultaneously (agent writes to OutcomeSignal + external tool)
   - **OutcomeSignal is always system of record** (preserves full context even if you switch platforms)
   - **Platform migration safety:** Started with Linear, moving to Jira? Your planning history stays intact in OutcomeSignal
   - **Multi-platform support:** Same Initiative can sync to Linear for dev team, Notion for business stakeholders

### Phase Transitions & Status Indicators

The UI shows phase context explicitly to help users understand process:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔍 ANALYSIS PHASE                           [75%]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Status: Working with Market Research sub-agent      │
│ "Analyzing competitors Zocdoc, Solv, Healthie..."   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For longer-running processes, inject personality:

```
Status: "Primary Agent: Hey Architect, got everything you need?"
        "Architect: Yeah, a cup of coffee and a delicious donut."
        "Primary Agent: On it.......(door slam)"
```

This serves multiple purposes:
- Humanizes the AI interaction
- Highlights complexity being managed
- Executive delegation framing (user is the "executive" directing the primary agent)
- Reduces perceived wait time

### Approval System - Adaptive Buttons

**MVP (Simple):**
```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┐
│   Approve    │ Need Changes │
└──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**Phase 3 (Adaptive to User Speech Patterns):**
- User types "Looks good!" → Buttons adapt to match
- User types "Ship it" → Buttons change to "Ship it!" / "Hold on..."

**Gamification Elements (Phase 3):**
- Confetti blast on phase completion
- Progress badges, streak tracking
- Time-saved counter

Agent can also interpret natural language approvals:
- "Looks good" → Approve
- "Perfect, proceed" → Approve
- "Needs work on the market research section" → Request changes

### Why This Will Succeed

- **Distribution Leverage:** ChatGPT Apps SDK (800M+ users), Claude Desktop Web Extension, then Linear/Jira integrations provide massive built-in distribution
- **Complementary Positioning:** Not competing with execution tools—we generate the planning artifacts they require
- **Value-Based Pricing:** $49-149/mo is accessible and offers 10x+ ROI on time savings
- **Natural Learning:** Users learn SDLC best practices through conversation, not by reading process documentation
- **Managed Service:** Unlike open-source BMAD/SuperClaude, we provide hosted orchestration, integrations, and document management

### vs. Competitors

| Competitor | What They Do | Why We Win |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| **Linear/Jira alone** | Track execution | We generate the planning artifacts they need; we integrate WITH them |
| **ChatGPT/Claude Projects** | General conversation | We provide coordinated multi-agent workflows, context preservation across handoffs, native integrations |
| **Consulting firms** | Expert planning | 10x faster at $149/mo vs. $200K+ engagements; scalable and on-demand |
| **BMAD/SuperClaude (OSS)** | DIY framework | Fully managed service, native integrations, optimized for product planning |
