# Conclusion

This architecture document provides a comprehensive blueprint for building OutcomeSignal as a unified Next.js fullstack application with Google Vertex AI integration for intelligent document generation.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
1. **Single Language:** TypeScript for frontend and backend API (Python only for separately-deployed ADK agents)
2. **Unified Platform:** Vercel for Next.js frontend + API Routes
3. **Managed Services:** Supabase (database/realtime), Clerk (auth), Stripe (billing)
4. **AI-First:** Google Vertex AI ADK for agent development, Reasoning Engine for complex workflows
5. **Real-time:** Supabase Realtime for live workflow progress updates

**Next Steps:**
1. Set up development environment (pnpm, Next.js, Supabase)
2. Implement database schema with migrations
3. Build core components (three-column workspace)
4. Implement API Routes for initiatives and documents
5. Deploy Google ADK agents to Vertex AI
6. Integrate Reasoning Engine workflows
7. Set up CI/CD pipeline
8. Launch MVP
