nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Admin client properly isolated to server-side. RLS bypassed only where necessary via admin client. Webhook signature verification via Svix. No sensitive data exposed to client."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Trial calculation is lightweight (<1ms). Webhook processing <500ms with proper idempotency checks. No N+1 queries detected. Efficient single() queries for unique lookups."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Idempotency implemented correctly via duplicate checks and ON CONFLICT clauses. Race condition handling via exponential backoff retry logic (up to 10s). Error handling comprehensive with proper logging."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization with shared utilities. Comprehensive JSDoc documentation. Pure, testable helper functions. TypeScript types properly defined. Zero code duplication after refactoring."
