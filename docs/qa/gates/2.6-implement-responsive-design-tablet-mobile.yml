expires: "2025-11-02T14:30:00Z"  # Gate valid for 2 weeks from review

# Evidence of comprehensive review
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 48  # All E2E tests in responsive-workspace.spec.ts
  risks_identified: 3  # All low-severity technical debt items
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3]  # All acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage
    ac_gaps: []  # No coverage gaps identified

# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security-sensitive code modified. Presentation-layer changes only (CSS/Tailwind, component layout)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Automated tests verify no horizontal scroll, smooth transitions. Manual device testing required for 60fps validation and performance metrics (TTI, FCP, LCP) - properly documented in completion notes."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling via React error boundaries. Proper state management with useState hooks. Fallback layouts for edge cases."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent test documentation with 48 well-organized E2E tests. Clear component structure following coding standards. Proper use of TypeScript strict mode. Good separation of concerns (mobile/tablet/desktop layouts)."
  accessibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: "WCAG AA compliance verified and fixed across all components. Touch targets meet 44px minimum. Keyboard navigation tested. ARIA labels present and verified. Screen reader support documented for manual testing."
  testability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "High controllability (viewport sizing via Playwright). High observability (data-* attributes, ARIA roles). Stable test selectors. Visual regression baseline support."
