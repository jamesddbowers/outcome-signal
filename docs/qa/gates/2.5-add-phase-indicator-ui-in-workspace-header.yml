review_notes: |
  Exceptional implementation quality on this story. The developer demonstrated strong
  understanding of React patterns, TypeScript best practices, and accessibility standards.

  Key highlights:
  - Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive test coverage at appropriate levels
  - Responsive design following mobile-first approach
  - Excellent accessibility implementation
  - No technical debt introduced

  Minor refactorings performed by QA improved production readiness without altering
  functionality. All tests pass, build succeeds, and code follows documented standards.

  This story serves as an excellent example of quality implementation for future work.
