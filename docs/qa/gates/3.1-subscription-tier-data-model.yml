  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Server-side tier limit enforcement functions not yet implemented"
    suggested_action: "Implement enforcement in Stories 3.2-3.8 as planned. Ensure validation before allowing initiative creation or credit consumption."

    severity: low
    finding: "Helper functions in subscription.ts (toUsageSummary, getCurrentMonth) lack dedicated unit tests"

  - id: "ARCH-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "No CHECK constraint for month format validation (YYYY-MM)"
    suggested_action: "Consider adding CHECK constraint: month ~ '^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}$' for format validation"

# Detailed Assessment Summary
assessment_details:
  code_quality_score: 95.2
  test_architecture_score: 94.5
  nfr_score: 93.25
  coding_standards_compliance: 100

  strengths:
    - "Comprehensive test coverage (46/46 tests passing, 100% pass rate)"
    - "Excellent database design with proper constraints, indexes, and RLS policies"
    - "Outstanding documentation (JSDoc, SQL comments, architecture docs updated)"
    - "Type-safe TypeScript implementation with strict mode compliance"
    - "Idempotent migrations with UPSERT pattern for seed data"
    - "Clear separation of concerns (constants, types, migrations, tests)"

  areas_for_improvement:
    - "Server-side enforcement logic (planned for Stories 3.2-3.8)"
    - "Unit tests for helper functions (low priority)"
    - "Month format validation constraint (nice-to-have)"

  requirements_traceability:
    - "AC1 (Subscriptions table): Pre-existing, verified ✅"
    - "AC2 (Usage tracking table): 13 integration tests, all constraints tested ✅"
    - "AC3 (Tier limits constants): 33 unit tests, all tiers validated ✅"

  test_coverage_summary:
    - "Unit tests: 33 tests in subscription-tiers.test.ts"
    - "Integration tests: 13 tests in usage-tracking.test.ts"
    - "All constraints tested: UNIQUE, CHECK, FK, RLS, triggers"
    - "All tier configurations tested: trial, starter, professional, enterprise"
    - "Edge cases covered: negative values, unlimited (-1), permissions, document types"

  risk_assessment:
    - "Security risk: MEDIUM (subscription/billing data)"
    - "Data integrity risk: LOW (comprehensive constraints)"
    - "Business impact: HIGH (foundational for Epic 3 monetization)"
    - "Review depth: DEEP (security-sensitive domain)"
