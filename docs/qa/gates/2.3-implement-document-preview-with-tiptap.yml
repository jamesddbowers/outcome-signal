# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Read-only TipTap editor properly configured. No user input processed. Mock data service has simulated network delay. No security vulnerabilities identified."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Performance optimizations implemented: disabled input/paste rules for read-only mode, immediatelyRender: false for SSR compatibility, memoization-ready architecture. Long document test (100 pages) included in test suite. Target <500ms render time achievable with current implementation."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling in MiddlePanel (loading, error, empty states). React Query provides automatic retry and caching. All 170 tests passing with 100% pass rate."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code structure with clear separation of concerns. TypeScript interfaces well-defined. Component follows React best practices (forwardRef, useImperativeHandle). Test coverage comprehensive (24 new tests)."
