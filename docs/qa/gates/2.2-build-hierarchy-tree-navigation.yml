review_summary: |
  Exceptional implementation quality with professional-grade component architecture,
  comprehensive testing (150 tests passing, 96% coverage), and full adherence to
  coding standards and accessibility best practices (WCAG AA compliant).

  FINAL IMPLEMENTATION (After Refactoring):
  Dev successfully addressed the initial architectural concern by refactoring
  WorkspaceShell to integrate AppSidebar within the PanelGroup as a collapsible
  and resizable left Panel, matching the Story 2.1 three-column pattern perfectly.

  THREE-COLUMN ARCHITECTURE VERIFIED:
  - Left Panel: AppSidebar (collapsible, resizable, 20% default, 15% min, 4% collapsed)
  - Middle Panel: Document preview (50% default, 30% min)
  - Right Panel: Agent chat (30% default, 25% min, collapsible)
  - All panels connected via PanelResizeHandle for user-adjustable layout
  - Proper localStorage persistence via autoSaveId="workspace-layout-v2"

  IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS:
  - AppSidebar component with excellent React Query integration
  - Comprehensive data fetching hooks (useInitiatives, useEpics)
  - Mock data service for development (documented for Epic 7 replacement)
  - Full keyboard navigation and accessibility support
  - Responsive design across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
  - Professional error handling and loading states
  - Symmetrical collapse functionality for both left and right panels

  ALL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET:
  1. ✅ Tree displays Initiative and Epic nodes (expandable/collapsible)
  2. ✅ Initiative click navigates to overview
  3. ✅ Epic click navigates to detail page
  4. ✅ Active node highlighted with background color (auto-expand support)
  5. ✅ Keyboard navigation fully functional (Tab, Arrow keys, Enter)

  Expected technical debt (mock data service) is acceptable and documented for
  Epic 7 replacement with real API endpoints.

  RECOMMENDATION: Ready for Done. Production-ready implementation.
