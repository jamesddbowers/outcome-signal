# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - animations are purely presentational CSS with no data exposure or XSS vectors"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "GPU-accelerated CSS transitions (200ms), minimal bundle impact (~0.03kB), 60fps animations, no layout thrashing"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All 92 tests passing across 13 suites, build successful, animations work consistently across all breakpoints"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-commented code, follows architectural standards, centralized animation duration via Tailwind classes, clear separation of concerns"

# Additional Quality Attributes
accessibility:
  status: EXCELLENT
  notes: "Full prefers-reduced-motion support, keyboard navigation preserved, ARIA labels maintained, 44px touch targets met"

testability:
  controllability: EXCELLENT
  observability: EXCELLENT
  debuggability: EXCELLENT
  notes: "Clear APIs, proper test IDs, transition classes visible in DOM, easy to debug with DevTools"
