# Review Summary
summary: |
  Story 1.1 represents a textbook example of foundational infrastructure implementation.

  STRENGTHS:
  - Complete requirements traceability (all 6 ACs mapped to tests)
  - Modern Turborepo v2.x syntax (tasks instead of deprecated pipeline)
  - Comprehensive test suite (18 tests) validating configuration correctness
  - Strict TypeScript configuration across all packages
  - Proper workspace linking via pnpm workspace protocol
  - Zero security, performance, or reliability concerns

  QUALITY INDICATORS:
  - 100% test coverage for acceptance criteria
  - All standards compliance checks passed
  - Production-ready configuration with no refactoring needed
  - Fast build (5.7s) and test (144ms) execution

  RECOMMENDATION: Approve for production. This story establishes a solid foundation for
  subsequent development work. The team has demonstrated strong architectural understanding
  and commitment to quality standards.
