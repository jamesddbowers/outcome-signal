# Notes for development team
dev_notes: |
  EXCELLENT WORK on this implementation! The three-column workspace layout is well-architected
  with clean component separation, proper responsive design, and good TypeScript discipline.

  The CONCERNS gate is due to two incomplete tasks (E2E tests and manual accessibility testing),
  not implementation quality. These can be addressed in a follow-up story if needed for MVP timing.

  Fixed one test issue during review: mock Panel now properly supports refs to eliminate warnings.

  Recommended next steps:
  1. If time permits: Add E2E tests (Task 10) for full coverage
  2. Before production: Manual accessibility verification (Task 11)
  3. Optional enhancement: Add interaction tests for collapse/expand

  All 5 acceptance criteria are structurally met. Code quality is high. Ready for merge with
  the understanding that E2E/accessibility testing should follow.
