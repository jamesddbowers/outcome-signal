notes: |
  This is exemplary code that demonstrates best practices in React hook design,
  error handling, and test coverage. The implementation correctly leverages the
  react-resizable-panels library's built-in persistence while adding robust
  custom localStorage management for collapse state. No refactoring was needed.

  The debouncing strategy (500ms) with proper cleanup prevents both excessive
  localStorage writes and memory leaks. Schema versioning ensures the code can
  evolve without breaking existing user preferences.

  Test coverage is comprehensive with 26 tests covering happy paths, error
  scenarios, edge cases, and the full user journey from collapse to reset.
