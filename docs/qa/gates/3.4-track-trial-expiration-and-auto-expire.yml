  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Service role key properly protected, Clerk auth enforced, no sensitive data exposure"
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Multiple sequential DB queries in checkInitiativeLimit could be optimized with JOIN or RPC. Caching strategy is good (5 min TTL)."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No retry logic for Edge Function failures. No monitoring/alerting for cron job failures. Error handling is good but needs production monitoring."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear separation of concerns, good documentation, consistent naming. Verbose console logging could be consolidated."
